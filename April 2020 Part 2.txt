April Week Two
Tuesday April 8 late at night
________________


I want more room on the page for my words
Like he wants more room for his cock
He wants me to go Ahhhhhhhh
About him
Like i do
About my pain
And how bruce knows it.


It’s the same.
Maybe i’m writhing around
And kicking my feet
And punching my head
And slapping my face
Until i only have 
The rhythm
The melody
The lyrics
And the sadness.


Oh my god I tried to date michael tonight
I thought i could do it
But i couldn’t.

I started crying right away
Faster than i thought
As soon as i saw him
It hurt
It hurt so much
More than burn 
Or because of the scald
Or bc he was still there without me


Why do they always push me to the edge!?
I believe in them so hard
For so long
And all i get is disappointment and guilt
And a general sense
Of inefficacy
At being a partner. 


I wonder if he’s getting closer to Roxy or Edit
Without me there?
The thought barely makes me jealous
That rowdy spot in my chest
Isn’t getting all raw and huffy and burning into me.
I just figure…
At least he’ll be close to someone
I wish it could have been me
I really do hope he finds someone that he can really be himself with
Even if it’s not me.
I feel bad that i’ve grown so much while we were together
While he’s stayed so much the same.
Of course...he was better off to start with
And it remains to be seen 
If my gains will endure.


I loved him as well as I knew how
I don’t feel any guilt about that.
I looked up to him,
I trusted and adored him,
I tried to be my sweetest around him
Except when he made me sad
And i tried not to be lazy
But he cuddled me so good
After a few years, anyway.


He says he thinks he’s boring.
I guess he’s just depressed.
Can’t he just force himself to say things?
Like he does with some of the others?


I don’t understand how I’m not the girl for him.
We seemed so perfect together
So goth.
Remember when I showed my student 
A picture of me and ben
And she said
Oh you look so cute together!
And then I showed her
A picture of me and michael
And she said,
“Oh, well, yeah,
That makes a lot more sense.”

Oh my god, 
Could I imagine seeing my g
With another girl??
No no no 
I never could. 






Oh my god.
Michael has killed me.


John pushed me away today
Twice, maybe thrice,
In the last couple of days
Because i annoyed him
Just like i annoyed my mom
And beta
And josey.


Not sean.
Not michael.


But it’s okay.
I know i’m a lot.
I couldn’t handle it myself.


It’s just too soon
And john would probably be really sad without me.
He’d probably wish i was still there annoying him
Than completely gone.


He came into the bedroom
Where i was listening to weird music
And gave me a kiss
And asked me not to be pissy
Because he pushed me away
But i wasn’t
And i told him that.


Usually i would be
Maybe the other girls would be
Maybe he wanted me to be
And normally i would have
Or maybe i was
But it just seemed pretty easy to get over
Comparatively. 


Right when he said that,


Is a dream a lie
If it don’t come true
Or is it something worse?


How could anyone not understand the tragedy of that sentiment??


John didn’t understand
Like i sometimes don’t understand him 
Like when i asked too many questions
And thought 
The story about the tapestry of 
The indian god of creation and destruction
That hung above his bed
Where sarah got pregnant
And she said,
What did you expect?


John said her father pressured her to abort
And he never forgave sarah or the dad for that
But i wonder how he let her down
How he made her trust her dad over him
And why she didn’t think
He’d take care of her 
And their baby.


I bet that’s a really hard question for him.
Really sad.
I had beta John’s baby.
Why didn’t new john
Find a lady
Who’d have his baby?


Was sarah smarter than me?
Obviously.


I guess new john should have picked 
Someone stupider
Like me.


I guess he has,
But now it’s sorta too late.
I used up all my fertile stupidity
Before he got to me. 


I’m So
SO
SO
SO
SO
Fucking horrified
By what my mom told me
About pop’s side of the family.
So much suicide
Then my cousin told me 
That BOTH of my mom’s 
Sisters were bipolar. 


So that’s three suicides and two bipolars
And who knows what else.


I don’t know what to think.
I don’t want an excuse
But i would like a reason
A justification
For all my suffering
And a precedent
For not taking it.


Yeah that’s right
I have a fucking precedent. 


________________




Wednesday April 9


Obviously i didn’t go to my zoom class
I was up all night again last night
Just writing
Not too sad
Or freaked out
Just doing more lines
Eating more waffles


Writing more pantone
Love letters to john
Like 
If he doesn’t want to me to 
Eat his cats 
And 
Feed his waffles,
He should stay the fuck up with me.


He found that card
After i had just told him
That i had been fine staying up alone
And wasn’t mad at him 
For falling asleep
Lol.


I wonder what he’ll think when he reads my 100page document of our first week of april.
He read the first 50 pages quickly in front of me
While i was dying
That friday night


But i don’t think he had time to ponder it
He was just grasping for clues
Of how to deal with me.


He knows he loves crazy girls
He admits it
He seeks them out 
And maybe
He suggested
Even tries to make them crazier
After he has them.


Wicked!!!
He says he doesn’t want to get
Trapped
Into another cycle
Of taking care 
Of a tragic girl.


But he sees that he keeps picking us
And he knows we’re vulnerable
And he uses all his charms
To win us over
And then says
“I like to be alone.” 


Like fucking beta.
He just wanted us in the background
Of his more interesting 
Outside life.
He wanted to tell all “the guys”
About how’s he taking care
Of this girl and his baby
And feel like a man
And he pretty much was
But he just didn’t like me that much. 




  



Then we listened to cat stevens singing trouble in the bed
After i listened to kristin hersh sing it
While i was washing the dishes.
It’s just that he sounds
So sad
And i understand it so much
And he has the pain
That i recognize.


And his solution was
To become yusef.
Grow a beard 
Get weird
And move 
To the mountains.


Is that what I should do?
Uhoh, John says he converted to islam.
I said, well, nevermind then,
Because as a female human,
I couldn’t do that.


John said, 
Are you sure you wouldn’t like that?
Don’t you want to be controlled?
I whined,
“Only if I have the choice!” 




________________


Wednesday late night 5am april 9, 2020


I’ve been up since tuesday?
We had our big drug tied up blunt force trauma night
On saturday
Slept all day sunday 
And all night sunday
And then got up monday
And stayed up and went to bed with john
And then got up tuesday
And stayed up all day
And all night writing in the living room
With the harsh dim light
And the hard chair
Or backless stool
And wrote my thing
And some cards for him
And drank lots of whiskey
And did lots of coke
And waited 
And waited
For cuomo
And when they put up the livestream video
With that beautiful
Comforting music playing 
While we wait for him,
I kept writing,
And I checked on John again,
Sleeping like a happy angel
And asked him if i could come in
And suck his cock
While i watched cuomo.


He said yes,
And i wrote some more
And waited to brew the coffee
And then cuomo came on live
And i rushed in
And gave john the mac
And pushed his coffee
And came back into the bedroom
And put his cock in my mouth
And sucked it
For the entire update
Until the q and a period.


He seemed so happy 
Sipping his coffee
Getting his cock sucked (by me)
Watching a good politician


Need to write about
Going to costco
Me trying to bail
Him appreciating that i didn’t 
(until we made it to the register)
And him loading 
And unloading 
All the $800 of things
All by himself
While i smoked a cigarette in the front seat,
And rolled spliffs in his bed
Like a fucking princess.


Why not? 
I’m a delicate fucking flower.
Now I’ve had a career
It was nice
But i’m ready to move on.


I assimilated all of our purchases,
Made a pile for the shed,
And basically minded my own business
For the rest of the day.


He complained tuesday
That i didn’t attend to him enough
Or bother him enough
Throughout the day.


I had been trying not to annoy him.
But he said he wanted more of me,
And then when I gave it,
He made me feel bad
For not giving him his alone time,
When he knows i like it too. 


Why is he annoyed
Already?
There’s no hope
We are together 24/7
Which is different
And a lot
But still.
It’s so soon.
 
Did he hear me
Or remember me
When i said that
I hate that feeling
That weird tension
When i can tell i’m 
annoying someone. 


Why is he letting it 
Happen already?
How can he love me
And also be 
Annoyed by me
So soon?


We had a little squabble
About how i think
He underestimates me
And explains to me 
Things i already know.
It’s not quite mansplaining
Because it’s specific to me.


He told me studs
Are boards in the wall
That are made of wood
After i questioned
Whether 
The ceiling light
Would be installed
In a stud.


Later he claimed 
He was sort of joking
Like when i said 
Washing my hands
For 20 minutes




His boner haunted us again tonight.
It’s just when he’s tired.
But when I hear him sigh
In that one certain way
I know he’s no longer
Thinking about me, 
Or our sex,
But just about his dick,
Which he says
Contains
90%
(fucking 90 percent???)
Of his sexual drive
And desire
And pleasure. 


Damn!
So my three holes are accounting 
For 90% of his love for me
And only 10% 
Is because of me.


That explains why he underestimates me.
Maybe he just doesn’t think about it that much.
Isn’t worried if his three-holed sex slave
Is smart
And is annoyed when she talks
And shooshes her
While she sucks his cock.


Does he really need ME?
I guess the idea behind the basic bitch
And his agreeable nature,
Is that if he would be just as happy
With a lesser girl than me,
He should probably 
Go that route.
Because if he only wants holes
And submission
Then there are plenty of girls
Who would be happy to take my place
And require a 
Lot less
Fucking effort 
On his part.


If he is not enjoying my frills,
Then why does he want to pay for the upgrade?
Just get the basic model,
Fuck her holes,
Ignore her when she talks
And don’t worry about 
How smart or not she is. 


His boner is 90% of sex???
If he’s got no boner,
The maximum he can enjoy 
My body and my love
Is 10%???
WTF. 


I told him I hope he never loses it for good
b/c then he’d have to reconstruct 
That 90%.
Talk about putting all your eggs in one basket.


Maybe he’d have a nervous breakdown
Like I did from Corona. 
He suggested that maybe 
He IS
Having one now, too.


Oh lord, don’t let that be the case.
I know all too well
That decisions and feelings
That seemed so obvious and real
Duirng crisis
Turn out to seem bad bad bad
Very short-sighted.


In costco
Where we went so slowly
Where he was mesmerized 
Like i used to be
And wanted to think so hard
About which beer to get.
I just wanted to get out!!!
But I wasn’t annoyed about it.
I was bored and uncomfortable.
He said later he didn’t notice
That my back was hurting
But I had my hands on it the whole time, 
massaging the muscles 
as we walked along 
the long cement aisles. 
He didn’t notice?
What was his brain doing the whole time?


At least he tells me
(eventually)
And i’m starting to recognize
When his tempered 
Yes es
Really mean np.
Like when he said 
I could cuddle with him as he fell asleep
For the second night
Even though I was typing.


But we all could see he would mind.
I felt him minding it 
And had to decide for him
That he rather be silent and alone
Than have me there clicking.


I guess he’s a light sleeper.
I knew it bothered him monday night
At my house
While i was typing in bed
While he slept.


My crossword consequence today
Was sweet.
But i forget it now.
Not like the train tracks.


I tried to date michael.
But as soon as i saw him
In that same bed
Looking at me with 
His unknowable gpa eyes
It was too hard.
Too too hard.
So i had to go
And then i listened to the river
And let my feelings out
By kicking on the bed
And i guess john saw me
And was worried 
I’d have
Another episode.


We had a nice night.W did the tursday puzz otgehter
And i leanred how to hype without my eyes
And we tlkaed al === lot
And he fukce d me soe
And we talked some more.


I asked hin mwhose traits he keeps assining to me but he had no answer.  


I know he wnteds me t go fall asleep in bed with him
But my thoguhts wont let me
Soon thehy wil


Costdco!
Keyboard!




I wonder if i shodl edit my april doc. 
Bedfore john read\s it
He asked if wrote it thinking he’d see it
And definitely not
I didn’t hold anything back
But i also didn’t 
Think about 
How things might sound
When he is reading it
Without expertise in my voice
Ideas 
Or intentions.


So i want to read it from his point of view
And then see if i have any
Expertise
In his biases
Interpretations
And perspective on how we sees my intentions.


Friday April 10 2020


I was so slow getting up today
After my 36 hours of sleep
Without any drugs or pills
Not even nyquil
Weed
Or advil pm.
Despite my picky neck


I felt so heavy
But Ineffective.


I wonder if these long sleeps
Chase out the other girl
Just like when he 
Chokes 
Or slaps
Me. 


She maybe gets bored
Decides she can’t have any fun
With my feelings and thoughts
And life
Anymore,
So she heads off to wherever else
She has to go
Read some math
Or bother someone else
Or tell her friends about all she’s done
All her new stories
And experiences
And tricky little tricks. 


I didn’t like it all today 
When john was telling me about his skype call
And said that something or other was supposed to happen
This summer
But of course
Now it will be next summer.


I can’t comprehend a next summer.
Who would I be?
Which me could be experiencing a “next summer”?
Not this one.
Certainly not this one.
The idea falls so flat.
It doesn’t resonate
It doesn’t ring a bell
It doesn’t feel “right”
Or predestined. 


It seems foreign, 
Inexplorable
In comprehendible
Ineffable
An idea
Or a dream
Or a threat.


I can’t imagine it
If i’m there
It won’t be me.
It’ll be new sophy.
Maybe she’ll love it.
Think it’s the best time of her life
And thank god she didn’t
Pick a permanent solution
To a 
Temporary problem.


But i think i did. 
I’m shedding some part of me
Just like my hand is 
Shedding the skin
I burned.


I’m just afraid it’s the main part.
Of what i thought was me.
And i’m afraid 
I won’t even be there
To enjoy 
Whatever someone might think is their present.


My future does not belong to me.
Present me has no future 
I’m just running out this season
And then they’ll replace me
With someone who gets better ratings
And doesn’t 
Have a drug problem. 


Maybe every once in a while
Someone will say
Remember the old sophy?
She was my favorite.

Hah, that’s so ridiculous. 
I think i’m in my own truman show
And my only audience member
Is clawing her way out of my head
Just like truman got to the end of ocean
And climbed out of set. 


Every new thing comes from the destruction of some old thing. 
Okay.
Like how the baby chick destroys the egg?
The human baby stretches out the pussy
The child ruins the relationship of the parents
The knowledge ruins your whole structure of life
And identity.
(And also turns out not to have been knowledge at all
But some whispy static
That got misinterpreted
By a desperate brain).


It’s too bad that my thrashing
And writhing 
To the River 
(the boss)
Freaked John out. 


He’s having too many
Second thoughts
And fears
About me.


Maybe it’s because he 
CAN 
See next summer
But can’t see me with him.
I understand.
I can’t see me with him either. 
It’s scary and sad,
Not just because we love each other
And thought we could make each other
Happy and whole
But because how will it happen?
When will we know for sure?
Will it be the end of me?
Or (just) the end of us? 


Anyway, I was sad that
It turned out to be 
Checkmark in the 
“Cons”
Column,
Because I really thought
I was finding a
Less harmful way
(to me physically 
And you emotionally)
To exorcise my demons
And sadness
And bad thoughts.


Like i said,
I was inspired by raffi
To shake shake shake
My sillies out 
And 
Clap clap clap
My crazies out.


Even I thought you were in the other room
Having your alone time
Minding your own business
Letting me take care of myself
Instead of being annoyed by me.


So you ought not to judge me
When i do it in a sweet way
That wasn’t supposed to bother you
Or hurt me. 
Or maybe I just should clarify.


I’m sick of clarifying.
I guess I’m at that depressing
Intermediate learner phase
When instead of being so impressed
By how far i’ve come
I see how far there is to go
And all the ways we’re so
Apart
And despair that we can every
Bridge that chasm.


I mean, if I can’t even bridge my own.
And the things we used to like
Seem to bring us down.
It’s just an ebb.
It’s okay.
I’m gonna do good today. 


I told him, 
Since he had to spend so long
Looking for his screwdriver
(after underestimating
My
Organizational system--
But at least he admits it--)
That i would get him 
A screwdriver
Or multi-tool
For his birthday.


I don’t think he noticed the occasion
So i pointed out
How sweet it was
That i referred 
To us
Having a shared future
As if I actually believed it.


I think he commended me 
Like when i said 
My brand new mantra
Was 
“I’m sooo happy”
(almost with that implied
“Babe”
He hates at the end)
And that i’d employ it
When i caught myself 
Soothing my brain
With the refrain,
“I’m sooo sad
I’m sooo sad,”
With no qualifying 
Terms-of-non-endearment.


I meant it be sarcastic
Or silly
But i tell him that everything i say
Is sincere
(expect when it’s a joke)
So why should 
I be surprised
Or complain
When he doesn’t notice
That it’s one of those times
Where I say the opposite
Because it seems so 
Obviously not the case.


I guess i’m too good at it.
But he said all that sleep
Did me so good
That here i was
Back to a bright and shiny self.
Really?
Is this what he sees as my best?
Maybe the distinction isn’t as big as i think.


I said i’m 32% of capacity
He asked how i knew
I wondered about it
And said because i see
Up to my floor
(i meant ceiling?)
And it was two more of me
Up above from where i am.
I can see it up there.
Is that a good answer?


What does he see when i’m at
What i think is the top?
Is that when he’s annoyed?
Is that when he’s freaked out?
Is that when he has doubts?


Like a million years ago in redding in the hot hot summer
(they don’t know about it
Here in chico)
I walked all the way to foodmaxx
(or winco)
And admired all shelves 
So neatly organized
With all the products.
They told me all the calories
All the ingredients
And the colors lit up my mind
And my excitement
Maybe because 
I had control
I wasn’t tempted
I didn’t want to eat them.


But when i called josh to pick me up
And got in the car in 
My elevated mood
He wasn’t happy for me
He was disturbed. 


Why.


When John and I hugged in the yard
He seemed so satisfied
And i felt so desperate
How can 
That coexist? 


Am i turning into someone else
When i’m with him
Than when i’m alone?
Because i’ve given up on him
(understanding)
Or am afraid
He won’t like 
The real me
Which i tried so so hard
To show him
To make him love
But then i guess i changed
I’m not capable anymore,
Can’t take care of myself
Like he wanted me to.


But didn’t we decide 
That was a game?
That he never wanted a 
Whole sane adult 
Woman,
He wanted someone 
That he could make 


But i cleaned the bathroom so well. 
He did like that
He smiled a lot. 


He
And all the boys
Say that the worst worst
Sex mistake
A woman can make 
Is to just
“Lie there”
During sex, 
But i’m pretty sure
That i can tell
He gets even more turned on
When i do exactly that
And he can fuck me 
Like a rag doll
Or whatever sort of thing
They interpret the
“Just lies there” 
Girl to be. 
Is it just lip service
To feminism and clitori
And to make them 
Feel better 
About their 90%
Valuation of women 
In terms of their holes?


Like it’s not so wicked
If they are enjoying it too
And not at all sexy
When they throw it in your face
That really
Really
No one cares about anything
But your pleasure.


So fucking rude.
“You have to do what i want
And also
You have to pretend 
Like you like it
So much
That both of us 
Believe it.”


And I want to!!!
I do do do want to believe it.
I feel it, too.
I feel that I’m loving it
That i’m feeling the pleasure
And the fact that i can give you
Just with my body
And 
My pretending
90%
Of what you say you want…
Well that’s pretty good.
That’s a really high approval rating.


I guess it’s just the implication
That every female
Can offer you those exact same 
Three ways of loving you
And i’m not sure
That the sincerity
I’ve tried to put behind it
Adds any value at all.


What can compete with 90%?
Not my love.
Maybe my cleaning the house?
Oma always told me
It was the woman’s job
To make the home comforting and inviting
And i scoffed and said why.


But isn’t that so fair
When she also told me
That if a man can’t take care of me
Financially and survival-like and with appreciation and …
Then 
“What do you have a man for???”
So truth.
Why couldn’t i see it?
Why did I say,
“Because I loooove him???”
Like love was a trap
A destiny
A permanent injury
That i had no choice but to deal with
And suffer through
And feel honorable about
Like 
Raising a disabled child. 


I guess because
I’ve always hated choice?
Why?
Why is that so deep-seeded in me?


And then why do i keep saying
“I hate being told what to do?”
Don’t I???
Isn’t that my most intense desire
To have control of 
My own destiny
And time
And mind 
And choices?


Ohh…..
Maybe I need to consider
(obviously)
The source of the control
The who or why
That it’s been taken away from me. 


Oh, John said that was
His main motivation too.
He wants to be in control.
What is his reason?
Is it the same as mine?
How can they manifest so differently??


If I want control,
Why is my solution 
To give it all away?
Except like he said,
I’m topping from the bottom.
But do I feel in control?
I thought I didn’t want to???
Fuck.


Wait. 
It’s what’s her fuck again.
She wants control.
Over me?
Over john?
What even for????


I’d be so fucking happy
To be an instrument
Towards something greater
Just like a muse,
That’s nothing new,
But…
Didn’t i want to know about it?
How it’s working?
Who it’s for? 
Hear some songs
Or see some smiles
Or i don’t know…
All the good things?
I just said i want the credit
For making a difference 
To someone 
A little difference to a lot of people
And a lot of difference
To one person.
Just consecutively i guess.
Not overall.


But I’m so selfish!
Look at me say
I want to make someone happy
But obviously
Only 
On my own terms.


Wasn’t i making beta happpy
Raising his child
And sitting in the background
Hiding my toys
And 
Whatever weird else 
He valued about my presence 
In his life.


I still don’t get it.
But that’s fine
I think I just needed somewhere
Safe to stay
While my brain developed
Like  


Dulli:         I have your soul but i am wasting it
        It’ll take a long time
         But I’m gonna make you mine
        I’m gonna make you blind


        And just like you told me
        I’m gonna crawl 


I thought this song was about a woman
But i guess it’s about heroin
Can i be like heroin?
Why should i want to?


So strange i told john
So early on
That i’m addicted to 
Getting men addicted to me.
Is that really true?
Had I thought that before?
I mean, of course
I like it when 
“They always come back”
Or can’t forget me
Or always think back on time with me
As something special
To be treasured.


But who really cares? 
Who’s ever been addicted to me?
What good did it do me?
None, I think
Pretty much none.
Maybe inflated my sense of worth
Out of proportion
To what i have to offer
So that i could be 
Extra
Disappointed
To realize
Whatever i 
Changed my self/mind
Into thinkin was real.
A longer fall
Like the two heights of me
Up above
Shaking their bitchy heads
At my 32%


Two days in a row he came in while i was sleeping 
And whispered sweet affirmations
Like his cup of coffee
That settles my brain


Okay what great fucking
I underestimate
Clearly
How important that is to me
So fucking hot
He makes me feel hot
I make him feel hot


I think the fucking prize
Is to make him come in my pussy
To overcome him with passion 
Like sarah did
Except she’s my warning
Like italy is ours
That that isn’t going to work out for anyone.


Maybe he’s wiser now!
He learned his lesson.
I’m less fertile than she was
And he is stonger.


I love how he accesses 
My reptilian brain
And makes me growl
And feel fierce 
And 
Powerful.


I wonder if that’s her.
Maybe she’s like her
(scarlett johanssen)
A brain 
Without a body
Without a way to express
Her fury 
And passion


So she figured out a way
To sneak into mine.
Maybe they are all doing it
Maybe that’s why we’re here.
That’s why, 
As a species,
We’re so perverse
So drawn to taboo
It’s because that’s what they want
It’s what they can’t have.
The extremes of physicality
Like war
And famine
And fucking
And pregnancy
And murder
And malaise
And insanity
And genius 
And hmmm but is math physicality?
Couldn’t they do that? 


Does he have more of them in him than others?
Do i? 


What did michael lack that john has?
A phd and a job?
A real interest in me?
A sex drive? 
Proxmity? 


I change so fast.
I can’t remember my 
Thoughts or feelings 
From one day to the next
That’s why i try to write them all down
When they’re interesting
And sleep it away
When they’re not.


What could be worse than uninteresting thoughts?


After we did the puzzle
(and he was again emasculated
By my excellence)
I looked up the inscrutable clue
“Part of REO”
And it was OLDS 
And it’s from the oldsmobile guy
And his name is fricken
Ransom Eli Olds.
Fucking hot.
I told John that’s what 
I wanted to name
Our boy child
But he didn’t seem impressed.


I suggested tonight 
That he harness his intensity
And desire to whip me
By blaming me
(like the other men surely do)
For his inability to get a boner
And make that work for us
Instead of against us.
I guess it helped,
Because he whipped me pretty hard
I think
I thought i was taking it really well
But maybe it wasn’t as hard as i thought.


Oh god, 
He offered me 
To read the email he was sending his 
Non-academic friend form chicago,
After i asked if i could read it,
After he asked if he could send him 
Our contract.


When he was finished composing,
He pushed his mac over to me
And asked if i wanted to read it
I said “oh boy oh boy i do!”
And then he said,
Just so you know,
There’s some amount of 
Male braggadocio 
In my descriptions 
Of my sex life.


I said, oh sure or sure,
I get it
No problem
Thinking that he might have
Said something crude about me
Or objectified me or something.


But by the first paragraph 
After the hellos
When he started talking
About his trip to abu dhabi
And morocco,
I realized what he really meant
And i decided
I did not want to read it
And i said so
(along with “oh...now i understand what you meant”)
And pushed the mac back
And rolled over.


He said okay
And paused a minute
And then asked if i wanted to hear the part
He wrote about me.
Thank you!
Yes, that is exactly
What I wanted.


So he did,
And it was sweet
And sexy.
I think he called me devastating?
Said we’ve been having hot sex
And cuddling and doing crosswords
And cohabitating 
Across both our houses. 


“Phew!  So, now I'm back in sleepy little old Chico, working on
mathematics, relaxing,  enjoying the opportunity to stay at home,
work, play, chill.  The oh-so-devastating Sophy, of extreme thirst for
meaningful hedonism and intellectual understanding, who I've been
romancing with all cylinders firing, has signed up for a two month
"sex slave" contract while we're quarantined together [check it
out--document attached].  We don't see any other humans, and just
split the time between our two houses.  Sometimes it's ropes and
bondage and wild all-night flights, sometimes it's cuddling and doing
the crossword, and sometimes she'll scrub the floor in a sexy outfit
while I do my mathematics in the backyard.  Ah, the glory of
California weather.  I thought I was too good to care about that, but
it is a pleasure to enjoy it during this time at home.”


I wonder if it makes him feel good
Or bad
To see that the thought
Of him fucking someone else
Upsets me. 
I hope it makes him feel good.
At least i care.
I guess that’s what all the jealous boyfriends say.
But there’s a difference.
Thinking about it just gives me some kind
Of weird tingle deep inside
I actually wallowed in it a bit
While we were fucking
To up the intensity
And it totally worked.
Yeah, if i needed to work up some anger against him
To show some violence
I could use the thought of that
To bring it out.
Easily.
Not even very deep.


Does he not have that reaction to the thought of me
Fucking other guys?
He’s brought up several times
That he felt the first hint of jealousy
Then or when
And he’s never ever expressed any 
Jealousy over michael
Which is beautiful.


But would he really want me 
Going out and getting fucked
Or fucking
Some other guy??
Moot point anyway.




Maybe not forever.
I don’t know.


Cohabitating isn’t as bad as I thought it would be.
I suppose that all in all 
I manage to bring it
With the sex and the fun
As much as i was before


And the other stuff
Doesn’t detract too much
We’re giving each other space
Doing our things
I suppose so.


I told him that he keeps talking
About needing his alone time
And he seemed surprised to hear
That i thought that.
I guess he didn’t notice he thought that?
I’m surprised i’m hearing it
Because i try to give him
Soooo much alone time
But maybe there’s a difference
Between being alone cause someone’s 
Not bugging you for a minute
And being alone alone
Where no one hears you
Or sees you.
Cause they aren’t there
And they can’t.
Sometimes I lock myself away
So he can feel alone
But he doesn’t usually notice
So i guess it’s working.


I used to like my alone time.
Now i’m afraid of it.
Why?
I used to like it so i could…
Listen to pop music?
Masturbate?
There really isn’t too much
That i’m embarrassed to do 
In front of someone i’m intimate with.


Sean taught me that
And michael
And john.
Beta wouldn’t even take off his boxers to fuck me!
Remember that!?
My god how weird. 


So why not am I not craving to be alone?
I think I feel enough alone
In john’s bedroom 
Like no one is watching me.








Number Nine
The Twilight Singers
Devil, sweet talking fly on the wall
Blackberry belle of the ball
Just like you told me
I'm gonna crawl
You trouble me
And I ain't myself anymore
I'm crawlin' around like a whore
And you love me there on the floor
Come on, boy, don't be such a baby
And maybe, I'll bail you out
One more time
You got number nine starin' at ya
Get back, boy, or I'll make you blind
You fucker, this here's where we settle up
One last sweet drink from your cup
Hand it over, slowly
I'm gone
Come on boy, don't be such a baby
And maybe, I'll sell you out
One more time
You at the foot of the master
I'm faster, but I'm gonna take
My time, and I'm gonna make you blind


Saturday Afternoon April 11th 2020
We had a great night.
I was sober all day and did a lot of work
Two laundry loads, 
Finally that bathroom floor
(it’s amazing)
And remaking the bed
Because john complained
It reeked like stale sweat
And i complained
But i like that smell. 


I loved listening to blackberry belle
While i scrubbed the beige tiles
Remember when i found out
My favorite sexiest part
Is sung by lanegan
And not even dulli at all??


Arggggg.
So growl-ly and slow and intense and intentional.
I love it when john and i growl at each other.
I love when bring out that intensity. 


[btw i snuck this out of the one i shared with him because i’m afraid he’ll read and think i overinterpreted his sincerity and make it less true


You asked me to listen to you,
Which is rare,
And I did,
And you told me to look at you,
And I always do,
And you told me 
As i remember the sentiment,
“Sophy.
Do not kill yourself.
If you do,
It will BREAK
My
FUCKING 
Heart.
I’ll never get over it;
It will be the tragedy of my life.”


My fucking god, 
How much that is what i wanted to hear.
That is all i wanted.
And his sincerity!
How he said my name,
How he looked in my eyes,
How his voice almost broke
When he said my death
Would 
BREAK 
His heart. 


He said it was the second time he was telling me that.
I guess the first time I was too kurfuffeled to remember
But i’m so so so so glad
He told me again.
It was the highlight of my night
In spite of when he smacked my clamped nipple with the computer case
And made me turn away
And tighten up
And hold my breath
Or breath real fast
Until the pain inevitably started fading
After 3 or 4 seconds
That felt like the way
John counts to ten.
(so slow...not standard or atomic...more punitive)


Or when he smothered me with my favorite towel
After he’d used it to clean up my piss
That i leaked on the ekornes stressless lounger
When i choked on his cock.
Until i thought my eyes went wild
But i guess he couldn’t tell. ]


I was really sassy last night
Three beers and some whisky
High off my triumph
Over the dirty floor.


I told him ought to learn my anatomy
So he doesn’t keep poking his boner
At my taint


I sucked his dick with my teeth
I choked him with the chain
I didn’t flinch from any whips
Or thrusts
I told him i would have had him anyway
And he tried to say no
Who cares either way
We both like it this way.


And I realized that I could definitely be a switch.
It would be extreme and premature to say
That he’s disappointed me,
But i had assumed that any such feelings
Would manifest as sadness
And a broken heart.
But maybe anger is more fun!


Here are the things I’d be angry about:
That fucking toilet
His boner stress


He fucked my ass while i was rolling 9 spliffs
And when i got distracted by the pleasure
And let my head loll, 
He said,
“Keep fucking rolling!”
I love it when he’s so commanding.
He didn’t notice when i just pretended
And rolled the same tip over and over. 


He licked my ass while i was in that same position,
Kneeling at the base of the bed
With my elbows on the mattress,
But this time i was writing this. 
I’m happy he listened when i told him that getting my bottoms licked
Wasn’t enough stimulation
And did that plan
Cause i fucking loved it.


I assumed or hoped he was reading what i wrote
It wasn’t for him
Just what i was thinking
And when he said he had
And that there was just one thing he wanted to talk about
I said “the girls just lying there”
And yep that was it.
I guess the part I’ve been missing
Is that they just don’t like it
The first time.
But after the woman has responded to his skill and virility 
With enthusiasm once,
He’s satisfied,
And now you can just lie there. 


I accidentally slept with my ankles cuffed and chained.
Now i can’t get back that sleep or the tiredness.
I thought i’d be up all night again
He even made me a bed in the music room
That bernhard enjoyed.


But by the end of the night he’d fucked me so hard,
And made me one fried egg
On top of another fried egg
That was the best sandwich ever
And i ate up all the bites,
And lay my head down
And fell asleep. 


Joy Division started playing a lot
While we were fucking once
And it made me sad. 


Saturday I did some chores and then we went to sleep early
I had a bedtime bottle of jameson in the crack between the bed and the wall
Sunday i did some more chores and then we packed up and came back to my house
Called mom and gave her the update. The last news was, “And then she says, ‘michael doesn’t talk to any of us anymore, and no one know why!” and we both burst out laughing and laughing.
And had the wildest acid party yet. 
* Jesus christ superstar on projector with screen
   * Used me as a footstool while i rolled spliffs
* Kids in the bath with still balls
* Tore the house up looking for cords and viagra
* Didn't need the viagra!
* So many bjs!
* Tied me up three times
* Hallucinated the smell of coffee so made it
* Put on the pink spangly top 
* He loved the bodycon dress (black with polka dots) but it got barfed on
* Lots of slutty makeup
* Blindfold and mouth gag
* Pretty hard face-smacking with the hard cock
* Pretty hard spanking
* Whipped me with the small one (almost as hard as he could!) while my arms were tied up to the ropes, and i was kneeling on the spinning ottoman so i could either escape his lashes or present myself for them. 




April Week Three
Monday April 13
I slept through easter monday. Missed Sean’s concert but he hadn’t learned my songs. John slept most of the day too, save for a few hours in his office and a really great fucking he gave me at some point. I think I might be ovulating now, based on the spotting and cumming. I guess i sucked his cock while we watched cuomo, but was pretty much falling asleep. It was still quite nice for everyone, though! I must have been sooooo parched, because all night long I dreamed about searching desperately for drinks, but everywhere was closed, or members only, or the machine was broken, etc. When I finally woke up, turns out there was a cup of water right by me. John says he got up for a few hours, but wasn’t feeling productive, so came back to sleep with me. 


Tuesday April 14
You know those words that seem like opposites, but really mean the same thing, like flammable and inflammable, or ravel and unravel? I feel like the threat of the virus unraveled my life, and now the threat of the end of the virus is raveling it. Or vice versa. When it hit, i finally had control of my life, and i liked it. I felt independent of anyone. I had michael, and john, and sometimes robby, and lumi and brooke and my job and my bike and my plans for Italy. No man was gonna pin me down. 


But then the virus came, and everyone abandoned me, and I was so fucking desperate and thankful when John came thru for me. I really do believe that I owe him the rest of my life. But people forget their debts easiest of all. And perhaps I’ve already paid it, giving him the most sex he’s ever had in a two-month period, the satisfaction of having saved me, and the experience of complete domination of a woman. 


I can tell he doesn’t like it, and I can feel him losing interest the more he positions me as a regular girlfriend. I even said tonight, “If you keep being so nice to me, I’m not going to be a sex slave so much as an unreasonably good girlfriend.” Am I right?  What other girlfriend would do the things I’ve done, in this day and age? Unlimited sex at any time, blow jobs for hours a day, “yes, sir” to whatever he asks, letting him dress me up...do other gfs do this on the reg?? I just really don’t think so. And if I go back to my independent self who doesn’t need someone to take care of her, then why would I want to be a sex-slave? The whole only point of being a sex-slave is so you don’t have to take care of your own self. If I had a job, and spent nights alone, and john dated other girls, would i be jumping up to make his coffee and warm his cock 24/7 of the hours we spent together?


Although, honestly, how is this different, really, than what we were doing before when we were dating? I always told him there were no limits to what I’d do sexually. He’s always been dominant in the bedroom. I think the only difference is that before I was hard to get, and then after the virus crushed my soul, I became easy to get, and all the things I did on our dates became the things I do all the time. He told me i didn’t need to play hard to get anymore. Did he mean it? Isn’t he getting bored of me? Am i getting bored of him? I don’t think so. Sometimes I don’t notice his presence as much as i used to. Sometimes he doesn’t look at me when he walks by but then he never always did. I haven’t insisted to him, like i have to michael, that he is supposed to look at me everytime i enter the room. At least g always say goodbye and waves his fingers when he leaves. 


Oh my god. I feel like i’m changing back. Like whoever she was has left me and i’m going back to the same person i was before. I mean i guess that’s okay. I liked her. She was mostly happy. Satisfied with potential future plans. It’s just that i got so excited when i thought it was over. When i thought i could give it all up and fuck everything i ever knew or trusted. It was so freeing. I loved not caring about the future. I loved getting so physically intense with john. I don’t think i’ll regret the scars, if i have any. I know i’ll miss that so sexy intense way of interacting. I don’t think i could find that with anyone else. Sigh. 


In addition to not having the rough sex anymore, the regular sex has become standard. Didn’t we always used to look each other in the eyes when we were fucking? Didn’t i love that? Now we bury our heads in each other's necks and shoulders. Why? I love being blindfolded when i don’t know what’s coming, but during regular sex…


I’m just so worried, now, that he doesn’t want me for either a sex slave or a regular girlfriend! That is just so fucked up. But...I can almost see it now. I can almost see that he’s just a temporary part of my life, here to save me from the apocalypse, from michael’s crushing betrayal, from my mental illness, but perhaps not to save my whole life from loneliness? I loved him so much, but now i feel so detached. It seems like neither of us is really getting what we want. He whipped me last night, and it was super hot, but today he made it sound like he only did that because he knew I needed the stimulation. I told him that my bruises had cleared all up, that’s we’d taken his suggested break from beating on me, and that i was done now with the break. We’ll see if that works. I just, just, just, just….really think he doesn’t like it and won’t continue. Can I go back? Can I ask to do it just twice a year or something? I’m like a fucking man. 


Tonight I made him mad by teasing him about being an old man and going to bed at 10pm. He said i couldn’t do that when i sleep for 24 hours at a time, but no, i said, that’s fucking impressive! Getting up early, sleeping in late, staying up late, they all kick ass, except going to bed early. He didn’t see the difference. Then he said some thing or looked some way and i realized he was getting defensive, and soon after, that he was actually mad. I guess it was when he said i was being “mean.” I immediately reversed and tried to hug him and said that i was sorry and would never be mean to him on purpose. He hugged me for a second but then pulled away and would have broken my heart if it were active today. He went into the kitchen and i followed him and tried again, “It’s just that i miss you and i wish you were with me,” and then he seemed to smile and redden up and forgive me. Later i sucked his cock, he jammed it into my throat while i was hanging my head over the bed, fucked my pussy, fucked my ass so hard, and then came on my mouth. Afterwards, while i was faint and out of breath with my forearm draped over my eyes, he admitted that my needling about his early bedtime had threatened his manhood and contributed to his staying up and fucking me more. So...what’s a girl to do? He also said that he was glad i had dosed him with acid instead of telling him cause then he wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much. Hmmmm.  What else does he want me to lie to him about? 


Is he still holding back being mushy, or does he not want to be anymore? 
Is living together ruining that?
I mean, it’s just vacation living
Not real living. 


I gave up on everything so hard
I don’t see how i can go back
It will be even more shallow than before
Faker
I just given up on everything so hard g
I let that other girl take so over
And now she abandoning me 
And the whole project


Can john and i really go back
To how we were?
Can michael and i?


Wednesday April 15 early morning 


Oh my god.
I’m so confused.
I don’t know who i am.
I feel so different today
Than i did all month
And i hate it.


I told michael
During our 2 hour date
That i’m afraid john and i
Are in some sort of trance,
And that we’ll come out of it
And be horrified by
What we’ve said and done.


He said, 
Horrified??


And i confirmed, confidently,
Yes. horrrrrifiiiiied.
My lord,
If he saw my burn mark…
What would be more horrible to him?
That i did it myself?
Or that john did it?
Or that both are true at the same time?


I forgot, gpa used to cut himself. 
He should understand.
Why is he so hidden from me???
It’s so wrong!


I cried so much while we talked,
When i said i thought that 
I had a whole nervous breakdown
And he just nodded his head
So sad
The way he does.


And about what madi said
I was surprised i hadn’t told him
It made me cry so hard
I could hardly talk 


About how sean said she had another episode
And the neighbors called the police
Because she was screaming that she would kill herself
And they think bpd 
And i sent her a snapchat video
Saying your dad says you’re sad
And i’m sad too
And i’m so so sorry
For things I did that 
Made your life 
Any harder than it had to be. 
I’ve always loved you
And thought you were
An amazing and special person
And i want to be here 
For you from now on,
Whatever you need.


And that suffering angel
Wrote me back
And said
We’re going to be okay.
I never ever blamed you for anything.
You were always a wonderful motherly figure for me
And i always loved you.


And it just broke my heart so much that 
Here i was trying to reach out to help her
And she ends up helping me,
Saving me so hard. 
How can she be so kind? 


About i also told michael about
him breaking my heart
About not being able to see any possible future
(he said that’s what depression is,
But i’m having fun now)


I said i’m so so tired 
Of getting my hopes all up
Only to get disappointed again
Is it worth it?
I’m sick of it!


I don’t want to fall in love again.
Or trust any guy.
Or any me. 


I sent him the pic of that opotamus flow chart
And he said it was good and sweet
And i should make more
But i said it was so generic
It could apply to any relationship
Change dogs to cats
Running to mountain biking
So bland.
So unachievable
So naive
So uninspired
So doomed.


I mean, what the fuck?
Is it just fun while it happens?
Oma didn’t have all this falling in and out and in and out of love
It’s ridiculous. 


I told him that he can’t 
even 
Imagine
The half of it,
How hard this has been for me. 


He said he hopes someday i tell him.


I asked if he read my emails
He said no
I said good
Because they would make him sad
And as much as he let me down
And as much as he broke my heart
I’m not really interested
In just hurting his feelings. 


He appreciated that. 
He’s so gentle.
I know he’s somehow trying his best.
We all are.


At the end i declared,
“You owe me.
You owe me.
I’ve invested 
SO MUCH
Time and love
In you. 


You have to either finish
Or do something else great
Because I believe in you.


And he said he knows
And he will.


I told him he has to live his life. 


I just don’t understand 
How i can be close to anybody,
How anybody can know me,
When i can’t stay the same
For long enough.


Gpa told me my mom is weird
And that she should have asked how i was
And that i’m right to feel cheated
Of a loving mother. 


That made me feel so good.
Then we agreed that rainer is weird too. 
How can he still console me?
Do I think he still knows me?
Better than John?
Even if he does,
What’s the difference,
If he’s not willing to be with me?


He said something about
How he doesn’t always know
What’s gonna make me mad
And i said,
“John’s figured that out too!!!”
And slapped my knee
And guffawed and laughed
And gpa did too
And that was really sweet.


Then I said,
John puts up with it 
Because of the sex.
Why do you?
He said,
Because he loves me.
That that’s just part of me.
And i’m his gma.


Almost broke my fucking heart again
After i thought it was in the most 
Indivisible pieces 
Already.


What’s the point of this patchwork love
Where one boy breaks your heart one day,
The other fixes it,
A third fires you up, and ties you up,
Till the other insults you
And you run to the first,
And my god.
That’s no way to live.


Can’t one man meet all my needs?
Can’t I meet all of his?


I know I’ve spent my life saying it’s impossible
But what if you believe?
What if you try really hard?
What if you don’t give up?
What if you treat each other so well
That you couldn’t do without that pampering?


Fucking breaks my fucking heart is what it does
I think i understand all the country songs now
Is this what they’re doing to each other
Even in the heartland?
I thought maybe this was a
Bicontinental
Multi-generational
Problem.


Do i like guys who are 33
Cause of jesus?
Where’s that put john now?
Or michael in a few months?


Sophy, [Apr 15, 2020 at 5:27:44 AM]:
hey steph! how have you been? i've been sleeping for 36 hours at a time


Sophy, [Apr 15, 2020 at 8:16:40 AM]:
oh my gosh, i just talked to michael for two hours, and it would have been the saddest thing ever if everything weren't already so sad. I told him he owes it to me to either finish or do *something*


Stephanie, [Apr 15, 2020 at 8:25:59 AM]:
36 hours is a marathon


I just had a class with a student


Stephanie, [Apr 15, 2020 at 8:26:31 AM]:
Oh dear! How did he react to that?


Is Michael doing O.K.?


Sophy, [Apr 15, 2020 at 8:28:43 AM]:
yeah i've been exploring the extremes of the bipolar spectrum


michael seems the same as always


very sympathetic to my tears


Stephanie, [Apr 15, 2020 at 8:29:09 AM]:
Ughh


How are you?


How are things with John?


Sophy, [Apr 15, 2020 at 8:30:57 AM]:
ups and downs


i feel like instead of his sex slave, i'm just an unreasonably good girlfriend


today i feel bizarrely "normal" and it doesn't fit with this new quarantine life i've built for myself. john seems foreign all of a sudden, when for so long he was my only comfort


Stephanie, [Apr 15, 2020 at 8:33:08 AM]:
Are you living together?


Thursday April 16 afternoon


I guess I slept all through Wednesday.
When John got me up this morning for Cuomo
I thought it seemed like I’d been asleep
Longer than three hours
But it didn’t seem like 28 hours either.


I guess John went to bed sort of early Tuesday night
And i got up and drank all the whiskey in brooke’s room
And decided i was still feeling normal enough 
To brave dating michael.
And i was 
We gothed for two hours.
It felt like good times
I guess.
If you don’t dig too deep
But then 
You never could. 


Friday April 17 early morning


Agh why am i up alone all night again?
Will i sleep for 24 hours tomorrow? 
I hope so. 
John didn’t get me up until 10
So i’ve really only been awake
For 17 hours. 
I guess if i make it till tomorrow’s cuomo
It’ll be 24.
It’s not a bad schedule.
Gives john some alone time
Gives me some alone time.


I really can’t believe I slept all the way through wednesday!
With no even pills!
What the fuck is up with my brain?


I told g 
That i felt like a whole other person
Like that girl had tooken me all over
Like when she comes in and steals my orgasms
But just all the time
And i was still sorta there.


But it was so fun.
I don’t want to go back to normal.
I just want something 
Like the virus
Or sex slavery
To save me from going back to normal life!


I liked it a lot,
It was great for a while
But it’s just not enough.
I’m too greedy.
I think there’s more
And i want it
And if i can’t get it
Then i’m pissed
And maybe
I don’t want to play 
Anymore.


Who said the game is rigged? 
Someone in messenger.


Even Cuomo said a couple days ago,
Again,
That it’s times like these
When people show you 
Their true character.
And some of them
Will break your heart.
People you were sure would be there with you
Let you down.
But then someone else,
Someone you never expected anything from,
Rises up and shows you how much they care.


Which of my times
Does john think are the worst?
When I’m so sad?
When I’m so mad?
When I’m not making sense?
When I’m mean to him?
When I tell him he’s not giving me enough?


I suggested that we have a deal where
If i’m sucking his cock 
And the baby cries,
He has to go deal with it,
Otherwise,
I will.


He said that sounds great
And if he’d known about that
He would have impregnated me already.


I was kneeling on the lawn chair
My head hanging over the other side
The top of the chair choking my neck
While john fucked me from behind
And we heard the neighbor children
Screaming and 
Throwing basketballs.


I told him that everytime he hears those kids outside
He should go out and just sit there
And do nothing
The whole time
Because that’s what it’s like. 


John told me he thinks I need religion.
I was horrified.
He said he was kidding.
I don’t get the joke though. 


I understand that michael doesn’t want all that pressure and responsibility
And doesn’t think he’s good enough,
But john does, doesn’t he?
Why won’t he take the job? 
Maybe i should have interviewed him
Instead of the other way around.

*Don’t let a real human being become the collateral damage of our clumsy attempts to plumb the depths of our affection.


I’m not saying I don’t want the baby.
Total bait and switch from some views
But fucking smart wizardry 
Of human management
From mine. 


I mean it makes fucking sense, 
right, 
To ask yourself,
Really fucking concentrate
(go Jamie)
On what the fuck you really want
Instead of using the 
Broadest fucking roller brush
To paint our purpose.


I mean that for both of us,
Of course. 


April 29


John john john what to do
What to do
I’m not good for you
I’m not what you want
Why don’t you know that?
So so so so so so so
Many girls would love you
And they already want to find a father for their babies
Why pick someone who doesn’t want that too?
Are you making sure that I want YOUR baby 
And not just any baby?
When that’s not true for you too?
You are so at odds with yourself. 
You want a family so badly
This rigid cold fucking thing idea you said


What about this.
No one ever got anywhere
No one became great
No one accomplished their goals
No one found peace


By fucking accident.


And why should WE???


We are so fucking smart;
We’re the exact people not to do that.
Tony Robbins said, 
Good efforts do not get you good rewards.
It’s so sad.
All these sad people
Saying 
I was a good man
I tried to be a good person
Why didn’t my life reward me for that?
Because…
You don’t get good rewards from being good.
Being good gets you poor rewards.
To get good rewards,
You have to be great.
You have to be smart.
And intentional. 
And we are.


Why are you trying to have a baby so haphazardly?
If you REALLY want this,
Then fucking divorce sarah
Marry me
Get me off the drugs
Give me vitamins
And do it right.
Do it on purpose.


Do you want to let things just happen to you?
Do you trust the universe to decide
With no effort from you 
Other than getting up in me?


Which of us is more confused?
Which of us has more to lose?


Why do i insist on preserving the viable spider webs when i clean
When i love the mosquito eaters so much?
Why do i maintain the mechanism 
To destroy
What i claim to love?


Or, how do i manage
Preserving two things
That are naturally at odds?


We want the baby and the love
The commitment and the freedom
The answer and the question.


I am not tied to you.
You are not tied to me.
Do we want to be?
Do we really want that?
I know i’m older than you
But i’ve asked you to know more
I’ve asked you to be trustworthy
I’ve asked you to be kind
And you said you would
But maybe i’m asking something silly.


I’m asking the fox 
“But you don’t really want to eat the sheep, do you?”
And he says, “well...ummm….[gnaw gnaw]...”
And i say
“Yeah, i don’t think you do...”
As you continue gumming the wool
And giving no response
I continue to convince myself 
What we know isn’t true
But believing is everything
And i still want you.


I’m so mad at you, john.
None of it is your fault, really.
No more than it’s mine.
We both know we’re being stupid
And hoping hopelessly for the best
As long as it still feels good
Right now. 


Do you have any conception of the
RAGE
That i would feel 
After having your baby
If you expressed even the 
Slightest
Fucking
Dissatisfaction
With this new paradigm??


I do.
I feel it bubbling up in me now.
It’s strange that i have more animus
Towards Sean than John.
John never really lied.
He never said i was so special.
In fact, he said i wasn’t.
So when we dissolved
I didn’t have to face some crisis of faith.
Like i am now. 


You’re making a terrible choice.
I’m a terrible choice
If you want a family.
You see that, right?
I see that.
Everyone sees that.
Name one person who thinks we should procreate.


Why though?
Why me?
Because i was here?


You lied when you said 
You weren’t in the mood
At this point in your life
To fall head over heels 
Because you WERE.
You always are.
That’s what you want. 


You want to fall head over heels
For a woman who tells you that you’re valuable
And that you’d be a good dad
(oh my god that’s i got you,
Isn’t it?
I bet me telling you that,
And that i wish you’d been josey’s dad,
Made you fall in love with me
Even more
Than when i suck your cock
Or tell you you’re a good catch).
Do you know that already?


But you’re not smart?
Because why would you half ass this?


Okay so i did tell you. 
I was more disappointed by your reaction than the thing
I read you aloud what you wrote
It was really beautiful
And i felt those feelings
Because you were describing them


But when i asked you what you thought
You said
You thought that i shouldn’t be
Reading your old things 
And getting jealous of old girls.


So you were mad that I snooped or whatever
And you thought 
I was jealous
Of 2012 girl.


I understand.
You were defensive
Which is fair
Because i was quoting you
Your own words and your old feelings
And you knew i was upset
So it felt like an attack. 


But...those are both so wrong.
Are you still maintaining some expectation of 
Your sacred man privacy
And i don’t get access to all of you
b/c 
Well...why? 
That cheapens it? Or you? 
That privacy keeps me from usurping your whole identity?


But I don’t want to do that
And you fucking DO WANT ME TO DO THAT!
How can you look at me and cry and tell me
With all your sincerity
That all you want is to be loved
(doesn’t that imply completely?
Doesn’t that imply loving your whole self
And not just what you wanna grant me access to??)
And then be annoyed or offended or violated or embarrassed
Or whatever you were
By my reading your journal??


And HOW
HOW
HOW
Can you think
That I am JEALOUS
Of some girl of your past?


DO YOU REALLY THINK MY FEARS ARE SO MUNDANE????        


I mean, honestly, fuck you. 


You want me to give you my whole fucking future???
My body
My freedom
My time
My whole fucking life


And you’re going to make a fuss
About your privacy 
Or me being jealous
About nothing???


What makes me jealous is you holding things back.
Do you want me holding back? 
Do you want to be getting to know
My curated version of myself
That is not 
The whole thing??


You know we need context to understand things.
Don’t you want it too? 


Next time I’m annoyed with you
I’m going to walk away from you
When you want to kiss me
And that’s exactly how the fuck it happened
With beta.


I remember where i was
And how i felt
And the exact thought. 
I’m sitting at the kitchen table
And he’s “gotta go”
Or he’s finally back,
And I look at him,
And I smile,
Or I ask for a kiss,
And I get nothing. 


I don’t know how many times that happened
Before i got pissed off
And gave up
And said
Okay.
If you don’t fucking smile at me
If you don’t fucking kiss me
When I offer that to you,
Then i’m gonna fucking stop caring.


Walk out the door.
Don’t say goodbye to your fucking daughter.
Don’t kiss the woman you bizarrely
And stupidly
Chose to bear her. 


I thought to myself,
One day he’s gonna miss this
And he’s gonna be sorry
That he didn’t appreciate it
When he had it. 


“Think 
while you still have me
Move
while you still see me
You'll be lost, 
and you'll be sorry 
when I'm gone!!!”


Just like jesus.
Except it wasn’t all clean and connected and logical.
He didn’t see that he gave that love away
Or i was too focused on those smiles and kisses.
But when it was gone,
I don’t think he knew why.
I thought I did, 
But how real is that.


Even after John and I talked, 
He was annoyed
When I reminded him
That I had mentioned
When totally fucking cleaning the cat room
That it would be so clean
That he could put his sleeping bag in there.


Why didn’t he appreciate my call back
To the traditional husband/wife trope
Of the man being in the doghouse,
When he had previously employed it
To his humor
To accuse me of nagging him?
That’s not fair or equitable. 


Of course he’s sensitive.
I am too.
I can dish it out
But I can’t take it.
So I guess it’s okay if he’s the same way
But don’t we need to know it??


I offered you a quarantini
And you said nope 
Not in the mood
But then i guess
Felt bad
And offered
That you were just uploading 
Some stuff you’d already done
And were not going to be
Involved deep and long.


I said,
Yeah,
I wasn’t TRYING
To make any kind of CLAIM
On your time
(you’ll know when i do)
I was just 
Offering 
To make you 
A fucking drink.


Also, after our “fight”
You conceded,
“At least you’re taking me seriously.”


WHAT???
About what??
Since when!??


When did you think I wasn’t taking you and this whole thing SO FUCKING SERIOUSLY!!!???


You thought I was just using you for kicks?
Is that what beta-sophy did?
Is that what you’re doing??


Until now you weren’t sure??
You want to knock up a girl
That you don’t want to read your past thoughts
That you’re not sure is serious
For why??
For what??


You say you’re smart
I believe you’re smart
So why are you not acting smart??


You know that we’re not.
You know we’re being dumb.
If you really want a baby with me
Then decide it
And say it
And do it.


Don’t put your head down and wait for what comes. 
That’s what I want to do.
Don’t make me be in charge.
Don’t make me be the one.
I’m sick of it. 
I want you to be smart.
I want to trust you.
I don’t want to second guess your decisions
And realize again
That i’m the one 
Who has to do the hard fucking thinking,
Recognize the harsh reality
Put on the brakes
And feel like a fucking enemy of love.


I told you,
If you want to do something well,
You need to plan it
And be smart.


If you really want a baby with me
And a life with me
Then fucking divorce sarah
Marry me
Get me off the drugs
And do it the right way. 


Or, if this is just a hot fantasy,
Maybe we should be more careful?


I think it’s weird that you have not read the document i shared with you.
Are you not interested in my secrets
Or knowing more about me?
What if i said important things in there?
Things that would change your course if you knew them?


What if i said I’ve secretly been on the pill
This whole time
And just fucking 
With your fantasies
Of having a baby?


I’d be fucking smarter than i am,
For one thing. 


No way you’re getting free sex tonight
Nope at all
You’re gonna have to rape me
If you want it.


I am disappointed.
Disappointed.
You are too defensive
You don’t trust me
You’re not all in
You don’t know what you want
You fear something 
That you don’t know what
And it’s interfering 
With our closeness.


Maybe you already fucking know you don’t want me?
And you’re just riding me out until quarantine is over?
 
That’s fucking fine
No problem at all
You can even trick me
Into thinking it’s forever
Cause maybe that’s what i
(you)
Need now,
But don’t fucking try to get me pregnant 
At that same time!!!


We can be quarantine lovers
Without growing old together.
You don’t have to completely
rescind/abscond/deny
What we’re doing now
Just because you don’t want it forever.


PLUS
I never did!
You’re the one who did!
You’re the one enticing me into some WHOLE THING
That i didn’t want or need
And that i told you
Would NEVER
NEVER work
Because I’ve already tried 
With all my heart
And all my values
And all my faith,
And it didn’t “work”


And it’s super fucked up of you
To try and convince me that this could
When you don’t even know what you want 
Anyway!
You said,
“Maybe you shouldn’t be reading my private stuff
If it’s going to make you get jealous.”
But...but...but…


I was trying to offer you to be so open with me.
I understand it’s hard
And it takes a while 
To trust someone new


But you’re not supposed
To fuck them over
And discount their sincerity
Just because YOU
Haven’t begun
To trust them yet.


You see???
I don’t know what game you’re playing
Sure you want to be loved
While also having your space
And your secret fucking self
And your “variety of women”


But why are you telling me that
And i’m saying sure
And then you’re still
Fucking hassling me
When you’re the one
Who wants this intermingling 
MOST?


I was fucking fine on my own.
Michael was some kind of dumbo magic flying feather
But not a real thing, i fear.
I had nothing real
So i need nothing real
And i don’t care if you’re real or no
But don’t try to sell me some fucking story
And then blame me for believing it. 


April 30


But. But. But. 


I think I need to tell you this. 
When you get defensive
And cold
And think i’m being mean
Or invasive
And instinctively withdraw,


Your whole “thing” changes
I can see it on your face
And in your eyes
And i can feel it in your energy
And your breath
And your stance


And i feel like everything changes
I don’t know you at all
You think you don’t know me
You close the door on me
And it’s the worst feeling.
I hate it.


It’s like my love has suddenly lost its power
To make you feel good
And i’m not sure i’ll ever get it back
And i can’t believe it can be gone so easily
And it’s scary
And it feels awful
And it makes me want to give up.


If you’re not giving me an all access pass to you
Then i don’t want it
I don’t want curated john
Or defensive john
Or self-preserving john
Or afraid-of-a-broken-heart john.


Everyone knows that won’t work. 
Your safety gear gets in the way
Of the whole process
And you achieve nothing
And plus??
Guess plus what else?


It’s TOO LATE.
It’s too fucking late for you to protect your heart
From getting broken by me. 
It’s too late for me too.
Why even worry about something that’s either inevitable,
Or will never happen? 


Can you think of one way
That this could end between us
And it not break your heart?
And mine?


You said you were less disillusioned
When you wrote those things about courtney
And maybe you believed more was possible
Or didn’t realize so much else was possible






Maybe you’re like Josh--”I promise you, I’m just not thinking about it all that much!”


We’re not happy because things are good
Things are good for us
Because we’re so happy.


So maybe all of these ups and downs
Aren’t really life, or john,
But just in my mind.


I mean, obviously
Other people suffer 
REAL ups and downs
But i don’t think that’s what mine are.
I consider my situation
And it’s so good
It meets, i think 




I found this old email from 2011:


On Sun, Oct 9, 2011 at 9:32 PM, sophy26@hotmail.com <sophy26@hotmail.com> wrote:
Muh my dear!  I began to send you this last night.  


Well it's morning, and I miss you, and he's at a soccer game, and I'm pooping.  :)


Now he's back, in the shower.  He had bread with tomatoes and avocado for breakfast, and I had a peach.


The romance seems to have worn off a bit.  


But there was penetration!  ...for a few minutes.  As soon as we started, he started saying he was about to come. He seemed a little embarrassed. I guess he hasn't had sex since he broke up with a girlfriend six and a half months ago.  He's still counting by weeks.  :)  I couldn't tell if he wanted me to stop and wait, or just go for it.  So I compromised, and it went on for a few more minutes.  He picked a weird start position.


Oh, and remember when you said that you don't think I'm clear about what I want?  So after he asked if I want to have sex, I said I had to ask him three three things first.  and I brought up stds, leaving marks, and safe words.  But there were no marks, and no need for a safe word.  He seemed confident that he had no stds, but didn't ask me until afterward.  He had nice condoms.  


Now we're going to get coffee before he has another soccer game and I drive back.


Kisses to g.  Are you going to goth night?  


Muh.




Do you see that part??? That even in 2011 I was begging for rougher sex and not getting it, and g said it’s because I’m not clear about what i want? But but but...it’s been so many years! And I got so close! And I am so clear!!!  What the fuck can I do more? I should just be happy with the sex John is giving me. It’s still the hottest sex I’ve ever had. He was right, I guess, we do need to keep upping the ante. Or I was right. It’s not that regular sex with him is boring--it’s that our regular sex before was way rougher and more intimate than our regular sex now. He used to choke me, and we’d stare into each other’s eyes, and now we just bury our heads into each other’s necks and could be fucking anyone in our heads. It’s just missionary humping now, and i don’t even get to go on top anymore for some reason. I feel sexy!! I’m not giving out unsexy signals. He’s super hot and I think I’m being appreciative of his body and style and swagger in a way that he should notice and like. I told him so many times today when we left my house how sexy he looked. 


  
  



I mean, look at what an attractive couple we are! Where are we going wrong? Or where am I going wrong? Maybe he’s perfectly happy. Maybe I’m making him happy, and i’m the only one with a problem. Maybe that’s why he feels powerless. It’s just that I feel like I’m telling him  how to make me happy. Maybe it’s like g said that made us laugh so hard. Maybe my reactions that make sense to me just don’t make sense to other people. Maybe all the problems are in my head.  I saw an email from three weeks ago where he said i should always tell him when i’m sad, because then he can make me feel better. But maybe not this often? I know it’s terrible when someone you love is depressed and you can’t help them. But I’m trying to tell him how to help me. 


I asked John if he thought he’d be able to tell if I switched from sucking his cock in the way that gave me pleasure (i’m such a selfish dicksucker!) to trying specifically to get him off (with the implication that I’m not enjoying it anymore and just doing it for him) and he said he didn’t think so. I guess that’s good? I do still like it quite a bit. I mean, as much as ever. And he’s taught me some good tricks. I love it when he just tells me what to do. And I love that i’m not worried about his boners anymore, so i can just suck on his flaccid dick for 40 minutes, through cuomo’s powerpoint and all the questions. 


I remember wednesday morning now. I finished talking to gpa, and i made john’s coffee, and i waited for cuomo to start, and then i sucked his dick so sweet and hard the whole show, and then he fucked me, and then i fell so soundly asleep that i didn’t wake up again until thursday morning (today’s) cuomo. Once in the night john asked if i had enough energy to pack up and move to his house, and i said, maybe later. Let’s sleep a little more. And we did! 


Friday April 17 evening


Today has been a very nice day. I’ve been feeling so loving and affectionate towards john. I guess we had talked a lot last night after I barfed and worked some things out. And I guess he had been beating me up a bit while i was cleaning the fridge. He pointed out some sick purple bruises from the big whip, and said he even broke part of it! Damn. I remember him kicking me, too. I don’t know why I love that so much. He asked if my renewed affection was due to him beating me up last night. I bet it is!! Such a great effect.


We had such fucking hot sex today. I was sucking his dick and he was looking at me and making sounds like it was the best one ever. Then i got on top, he squeezed my nipples, then he got on top, and after some sweet fucking, where we did look into each other’s eyes again, I said, “I want you to come inside me,” and he did, and it was so fucking beautiful. He came so hard and long, and then he collapsed in my arms and kept renewing his groans of pleasure. I wish I’d known it could be so good for him! I thought he liked pulling out and using his hand. He told me that asking him to come is a secret password for turning him on and putting him over the edge. Good to know! He warned I shouldn’t say it though, unless I really wanted him to come. Double edged sword!


John said, after I’d made his 57th cup of coffee, “you know who never made me coffee?” lol, of course. He always apologizes for complaining about her, but i love hearing ways that i’m making him happier than she (or anyone) did (or could).


We had a Zoom double date with Meher and Marie, which was pretty fun. We watched a video of Meher getting his full body tat, and i complained about kim jaxon being such a bitch. We got cut off at the end, and we’re hoping they didn’t hear me say “Oh my gosh how can she put up with that guy!” and it wasn’t really about meher as a person but men as a species or whatever they are. 


I go soooo drunk, and I’m not sure how. I don’t think I drank any more than I usually do. But I got so mad at him, and meher, and men, and life!

* You
---------- Forwarded message ---------
...
Phew!  So, now I'm back in sleepy little old Chico, working on
mathematics, relaxing,  enjoying the opportunity to stay at home,
work, play, chill.  The oh-so-devastating Sophy, of extreme thirst for
meaningful hedonism and intellectual understanding, who I've been
romancing with all cylinders firing, has signed up for a two month
"sex slave" contract while we're quarantined together [check it
out--document attached].  We don't see any other humans, and just
split the time between our two houses.  Sometimes it's ropes and
bondage and wild all-night flights, sometimes it's cuddling and doing
the crossword, and sometimes she'll scrub the floor in a sexy outfit
while I do my mathematics in the backyard.  Ah, the glory of
California weather.  I thought I was too good to care about that, but
it is a pleasure to enjoy it during this time at home.


Emphasis mine! I fucking love it. What a great description. And look how he admits that he’s been romancing me with all cylinders firing! He wanted me all along, the whole time. Maybe his cock knew before his brain did? Is that where his conscious subconscious lives? I still don’t understand how I wasn’t knocked fucking right over when I first got near him at the dept bbq (which, btw, i claimed as my turf, in the case that we bust up, lol. he ageed). Where is my spidey sense? He said Sarah always sensed it, but didn’t confirm my previous understanding that she thought i was befriending her to get to him. That’s good if she never thought that, since it wasn’t true. I just don’t understand why there wasn’t some bolt of electricity when I first saw him. Maybe there was. I mean, I still have a fucking clear-as-day picture in my mind of where were standing outside the stofa’s house near the taco truck, sarah to the left near the house, john to the right, and i felt bad because even though I thought she was my interest, i introduced myself and offered my hand to john first, because i knew he was the mathematician. Is that sexist? But then i turned to her, i told her that i liked her whole (hands sweeping up and down) thing, and she said he liked mine, and i guess while this was happening john was standing there watching us interact, his current and future lovers, admiring each other, both so innocent and excited with new beginnings, yet, perhaps she was already preparing to transfer the honor of attending to John’s cock to me. John says she was on high alert right away--because she knows what kind of girl he likes? Because she knows the kind of girl I am? Was it paranoia or premonition?? Would she have been as bothered by any other woman? I should ask john that, though he’s never given me the impression that she was a jealous wife. Was she just normally cautious of her man, or did she sense that I was a particularly well-suited candidate for loving her husband? 


Cuomo: CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART.
We have to open for a better future than we’ve ever had 
Saturday April 18 late night


We had a sweet double zoom date with Kev and Carolina. I was pretty good this time except for when I pressured them into starting a baby raising commune with me and john. Lol. Later I was showing him some of the Pantone cards I did last night, and had to reveal my hiding place of the ones at the bottom. I wanted him to see the one where I complained that one month of quarantine equaled 15 years of marriage (due to my extra sexual desires), but then he also saw the one that says, “I even offered him the fucking baby! What more does he want!?” teehee. I think he probably didn’t mind and probably thought it was sweet. He is so sweet.  We’ve been having such a nice time together.  Both yesterday and today i’ve felt so much affection towards him, and i know he appreciates it. Friday night we did molly and stayed up till dawn (like I am by myself this next night--up, not molly. I’m fueled by whisky and cleaning. What did I tell Meher and Marie were the three things that are saving me? Cuomo, John, and spliffs? Is there a g-rated version of that? Yes! It’s my perm!!) and had so much amazing sex. It felt so good physically, but also in our hearts. I can’t find a way to hold him gently enough and strongly enough at the same time. I want to cradle his head in my hands while I kiss him so hard we break right through the imaginary physical barriers that separate us. Like that time in oakland when I tried to smash our third eyes, but less violently desperate and more lovingly entranced.   


He woke me up around noon today, by coming into the bedroom, peeling off his pants and then his shirt, kneeling on the mattress next to my face, and angling his cock into my mouth. I love it so much. We had fabulous sex, where I forced him to look at me, and held onto him and fucked him and felt him fucking me until he came in my pussy. Again. It’s so fucking lovely. I love it so much. It feels so complete. Fucking icing on the cake. I think this was the third time in two days? Remember when our birth control method was “whatever”??  Lol, that was the fucking high protocol! That’s back when we were careful and he didn’t come inside of me. Now we’ve moved on to “well, we didn’t get pregnant so far, so we can probably push the envelope a little farther.” Remember when it was such a thrill to first let his penis inside me without a condom on!?? Wow. We used them for so long. When did we stop? I remember I was mad because I felt like it happened without me knowing (and I wanted to anticipate and appreciate!), which is so fucking rich considering that I stealthed him by sneaking off the condom, and committed what I think would be a literal sexual assault if he hadn’t fucking loved it. Oh my gosh, when did we stop using condoms? I guess before he left for the UAE. After winter break? Were we using them for the whole first half of our relationship? My god it is a slippery slope. First we used condoms every time, then we moved to him coming outside of me, and now we’re onto him coming inside me, with a vague nod to when i might be ovulating or not. This is exactly what happened with beta, btw. We weren’t trying to get pregnant, but also, we weren’t trying to NOT get pregnant, either. I liked to say, we knew how reproduction works. And that’s exactly the fuck that john and I are doing. My only additional justification is that I’m vaguely old? Or that new John deserves a baby more than beta did? What the fuck are we doing? He doesn’t want to deal with another abortion. I never wanted to deal with one ever. Do we want a disabled baby? Or even a fucking genius one?? No no no yes yes yes. I have no idea. I should, shouldn’t I? He’s an innocent. He doesn’t know how hard and draining parenting is. But then, maybe it wouldn’t be for him. Or with him. If he really wants a baby, he should pick a million of those healthy-ish basic bitches instead of me. Almost everything he likes about me/doesn’t like about them would be rendered irrelevant after the baby arrived. All my quirky cock sucking charm will likely be replaced by baby worship, exhaustion, and withdrawal from his cock.  Or maybe it would be just the most beautiful experience ever? No no no. that’s never how it works. Well, I did decide we could afford a nanny, but then he’ll prolly just fuck her. Agh what to do. I just don’t feel like I should decide, because I already had my baby. I felt it and loved it and accomplished it and suffered through to the other side. John hasn’t had that chance, but do men really even need it as much as women? I’m just so worried that either I’m robbing him of the chance to be a father, or that I might have to face him having a baby with another woman. Arggggh.  I guess i pick a) no baby b) baby with me c) baby with basic bitch.  Agh but do I? I still think I could switch b) and c), and then he’d still love me for my personality and my pussy, which I think is sexier than loving a woman’s role as your child’s lifegiver. I mean, I’ve seen how weakly a child bonds its parents together. If I have his fucking baby and THEN he dumps me? Urgh. no way no how. 


We just had such a sweet little day together though. There is so much mutual appreciation passing back and forth between us. It feels lovely and intoxicating and precious and rare. I can’t turn it back in. I wouldn’t. Who would!? Why?? But how do I sustain it? I know we’ve been asking this all along--how do you sustain romantic love?? But before it was philosophical, academic, and flirtatious. Now I just want to love John and have him love me forever and I never want it to slow or wane or ebb or fade. It would break my fucking heart if I ever thought someone else had more power to bring him pleasure and joy than i do. Is that selfish? 


What about michael? I used to feel that way about him, but now, after trying so long and so hard, i think i would be happy to learn that someone, anyone, has the power to bring him some peace and joy. I’ve tried for twelve years...feels like ninety. I’m not succeeding. I ought not to throw good money after bad. If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. 


Sunday April 19, 2020 afternoon


I managed to stay up all night last night, all the way to cuomo! I’m not even really sure what i did--definitely cleaned the toilet and the windowsills and frames, wrote a little bit...yeah not really sure. But the last time I peeked into the bedroom to check on John I saw his eyes were awake so I jumped in with him, even though I was sillily wearing the beige jacket that’s already too big on him (not the one of the road night, he says. It’s the one he left at my house after he wore it to laird’s party. 


I brought myself over my little furry pink ipsy bag of makeups and other essentials and set it on the bathroom counter. Later, after his shower, when we were talking about things we wanted to get from my house, he said, “you should take out the little spoon in your make-up bag and replace it with the one i got you in morocco.” I was like, fuck yeah i should, and then i did. It matches perfectly. Did i write about how he brought me two sweet little trinkets from his trip? I opened the first and it’s an adorable little glass bottle/container with some fabric flair on it, and i really liked it and i was happy and i said thank you, and then i opened the second gift, a little colored folded over paper bag in a magenta tone. I loosened the tape, pulled up the flap, and of course, of course of course who could have guessed what was in there? Not me! It was a fucking tiny spoon. A tiny spoon with pink striped detailing, so authentic and useful and perfect and for me. Meaning no disrespect to the glass bottle or my pleased reaction to it, I couldn’t help but light up with glee and exclaim “Oh my gosh it’s perfect!!! It’s so pretty and tiny of a spoon!”  There was just no way to compare my two reactions, because the tiny spoon dug into my favorite heart spot and that adorable bottle never stood a chance were it to be a competition of delight.   


The next time we went to my house I got his gift spoon, but i couldn’t trade them places. Why, I think they’re in love! I had asked him if he looked through my bag to check out my sexy makeup, but he said actually he knocked it over and everything spilled out on the floor, and then he looked through it for sexy stuff or not-so-romantic spoon selection. 


Monday April 20 daytime


Last night we had a blast. We did molly and he stayed up with me all the way till dawn. There was so much hot fucking. The molly got into my nerves and my feelers because it felt so fucking good to touch my body onto his, and my beautiful love for him felt extra strong and beautiful. So exquisite it’s hard not to cry when we’re so close. Over the weekend we finished the first season of Josh, and i was pleasantly reassured when he agreed that he likes it a lot more now that he sees the nuance and such. I feel a little bad for forcing him to watch so much television, but i’m giving him the best quality stuff, *and* I either give him a massage or suck his cock while we’re watching, so that’s not such a sacrifice! He said he hasn’t said anything to sarah about him dating anybody, and that the only thing he’s said that could have given it away is that he’s been watching cuomo, and she knows that he wouldn’t do any screen time on his own other than porn or reddit. 


We had such a great party night, though. He tied me up, he tried to fucking brand me with the typesetting letters I provided them, but they are made out of some metal with a low melting point, possibly lead, and the first one splatted on the floor with a lovely metallic frost. The next “J” he heated not so long, and pushed against my hip for just the flash of a second. Hot! But fleeting. I loved how it was so sudden and decided and planted. 


He was pretty blurry and congested when he woke up this morning. The first thing he asked me was if I’d cleaned the toilet, and i was like YEAH. Lemme tell you bout all the shit I cleaned.

All right—try it the other way (as the bishop said to the barmaid). Why are men, taken on average and as a whole, funnier than women? Well, for one thing, they had damn well better be. The chief task in life that a man has to perform is that of impressing the opposite sex, and Mother Nature (as we laughingly call her) is not so kind to men. In fact, she equips many fellows with very little armament for the struggle. An average man has just one, outside chance: he had better be able to make the lady laugh. Making them laugh has been one of the crucial preoccupations of my life. If you can stimulate her to laughter—I am talking about that real, out-loud, head-back, mouth-open-to-expose-the-full-horseshoe-of-lovely-teeth, involuntary, full, and deep-throated mirth; the kind that is accompanied by a shocked surprise and a slight (no, make that a loud) peal of delight—well, then, you have at least caused her to loosen up and to change her expression. I shall not elaborate further.
Women have no corresponding need to appeal to men in this way. They already appeal to men, if you catch my drift. Indeed, we now have all the joy of a scientific study, which illuminates the difference. At the Stanford University School of Medicine (a place, as it happens, where I once underwent an absolutely hilarious procedure with a sigmoidoscope), the grim-faced researchers showed 10 men and 10 women a sample of 70 black-and-white cartoons and got them to rate the gags on a “funniness scale.” 


*Wednesday April 22 (in retrospect) *anniversary! 
So I managed to sleep for FIFTY HOURS straight! All day Monday after Cuomo and John fucked me to sleep, all night Monday, all day Tuesday, and all night Tuesday. Until we left for my house Wednesday afternoon for our Anniversary Date. I didn’t even take any opiates or wake up for any spliff breaks. John came in consistently to fuck some part of me and it was always welcome and enjoyed and led me straight back into my sleep. I feel like I could even have slept longer!
