April 2020 Part 3
Saturday Apr 25 10pm


Yikes I haven’t written in a week. So much fun and fucking and then sleeping. I slept for 50 hours on Monday and Tuesday! Wild! Must be a record. No even opiates or spliff breaks. If you look back at Part 2 you’ll see that John and I stayed up all night Sunday partying (that is the 19th, the sunday prior to our big anniversary wednesday), and are about to do so this Sunday again!


Sunday Apr 26 sunset


We’re getting ready to move back to John’s house. I’m continuing the monumental task of uploading all my pre-google-photos photos from the external hard drives where i dumped the various outdated digital media cards of the 2000s and early 2010s. I’ve gotten into the thick of the files, where they aren’t clearly labeled by the containing folder, and all sorts of surprises inside like michael’s 2006 year at NYU, his graduation in 2009 that I wasn’t invited to, and thousands upon thousands of skype screenshots from his first year in Germany. I forgot that he used to smile. I never knew how much 22 yr-old michael, with his narrower jaw and pointier chin, looks so much like 44 yr-old sophy! Sometimes i was so fooled. I forgot he used to take his cock out sometimes. 


It’s important to dig deep at this phase, bc once i label this hard drive ‘uploaded’ I might never revisit it. When I upload the photos, i get to see a tiny tiny movie in the corner of the screen, often like stop-motion animation due to my frequent screenshotting. It’s mesmerizing, revealing, sweet, stinging, sad, impossible to look away from. 


Last night John switched from covering me with his body and fucking me so deep and good to lying down and wanting me to kneel on top of him sucking his balls. It was sooo much less stimulating, after something i had liked so much. I couldn’t get into it. I felt like i was being disingenuous. I stopped and said i was too much in my head. The next morning he said, “that wasn’t like you,” and “that was weird.” Hahaha like “me”???  You clearly haven’t been paying attention. I was surprised he framed it so negatively. I thought honestly was always the best policy but maybe he just wanted me to keep sucking his cock. He said “I thought about pulling my sex master card and forcing you...and maybe that’s what i should have done...” I didn’t say one way or the other.  I guess the idea is that it was too late by then. He should have been sex slaving me harder all along. He knows I don’t like to be having my hands and feet and eyes and neck and everything all exposed and just my mouth busy. I had a collar on; he could have been choking me (high-five excellent use of semi-colon). I told him before if he’s too distracted to pull on the collar he should hook it up. But is it too selfish of me not to want him to relax and enjoy my excellent cock-sucking? I mean no. He gets plenty of time for that!
This morning I was sipping the coffee he’d made me while cuomo was starting, and he got his laptop and checked his email next to me. All day yesterday i’d been sitting too far away from him. Why was i feeling so weird and detached? What preceded it? Lots of sleep? Lots of whisky? And so I realized, this is when it changes! These are the little fucking things that ruin it. I think, for the second day in a row, “well, i’ve sucked his cock a lot. Maybe i’ll just relax and sit not too close and smoke my spliff.” But that’s the slippery slope!! That’s how it happens! So I leaned over and put my spliff down, and as i edged back towards him he said, “you wanna suck my cock?” and I said yes I do. 


On Thursday or Friday I got up and made him egg mcmuffins on his request! He loved em too. That was a sweet part of a day following our big anniversary night! 


Day 57

Now we’ve got a bet going on whether
everything i say can be justified.
I mean, obviously.
#humor
#truth
#belonging
Accounts for all verbalizations.


Monday April 27 afternoon 


We both agreed that it’s good we didn’t let the “taking a day off” from cuomo cock sucking pattern continue, although it’s unclear if he recognized it (or, indeed, if it were one). Sometimes i think i might be thinking about things more than other people are. Or just different things???


No i don’t need a list of dealbreakers aka moments when i’ll know things are over for sure. But go ahead and add when you fart three times the day after our 1st anniversary,.wear sweatshorts to dinner..or if you ever invite me bowling, or I go two mornings without wanting to suck your cock, or you put an empty ice cube tray back into the freezer. #whenitsover when he’s just peein in there forever while i’m brainstorming a list of #whenitsover moments.


Brb doing 8 minute buns


I’m more pleased with the idea of brooke behaving oddly than the i am with the thought of reverting to wearing a seatbelt again


There’s always more questions...that doesn’t mean there’s always more answers. 


Or more interesting questions. Or even different questions. 


We should do shots about it!  Or fuck about it.  (after the buns) and the lines.  


He’s says “yes, they’re definitely big enough”


And also “a proper pour” into “your own vessel”


*remind me to look at security cam footage of brooke watching me and john high fiving in celebration of trying to have a baby


sensation=clarity brings us back to fucking


Ways in which john is the same and different as our perception of brad pitt


SAME as Brad
Got super hot goth chick angelina jolie with big cock sucking lips and an independent nature to have him 11 babies
Skin tones--more werewolf than vampire
Potential for silver foxiness
Ability to pose as a doctor (fauci on snl)
Possibly too full of himself but undeniably talented
Stormy-eyed loner with a fist to show the whole town (and that puss!)
Comfortable in a disco, western, or futuristic environment
Charms your mom and fucks your sister


DIFFERENT from Brad 


Younger
possibly/probably smarter
Less wrinkled
Fewer awards
Fewer stds
Fewer helicopters
Less competition/easier access


Acid insights:
John hasn’t even trusted me till now
He’s been so much defensive than i realized
I hate realizing i didn’t know where i was
Or where he was in relation to me. 


How did he make up this thing about having barely covered up from me his multiple applications to other universities? 


Like Gayle said about the hammer and the dance, if you all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And John and I are like cats or fighting toddlers, trying to process feelings that they don’t have the intellectual capacity to even comprehend, let alone express.  We need to fucking learn to use our words before we make a big mistake. 


Your not-planning-ahead plan has worked for you so far because nothing has been literally life or not life. 


*Don’t let a real human being become the collateral damage of our clumsy attempts to plumb the depths of our affection.


I’m not saying I don’t want the baby.
Total bait and switch from some views
But fucking smart wizardry 
Of human management
From mine. 


I mean it makes fucking sense, 
right, 
To ask yourself,
Really fucking concentrate
(go Jamie)
On what the fuck you really want
Instead of using the 
Broadest fucking roller brush
To paint our purpose.


I mean that for both of us,
Of course. 


I just think that we should both really examine what we think this pinnacle apex acme of this baby fantasy is. Is it when we think you might fucking come in my pussy? Cause that’s fucking hot and it’s all downhill from there. Are we having this lovely afternoon while Iris sits upright on a baby blanket under the trees, waving little rattlers around and smiling at us with more love than we thought we had to give each other?


*bipartite graph. Take some things, see how many ways you can connect em, then  decide that some of them are the same as each other and others are different, and then see all the more fucking ways you could combine em 


Once again i had the epiphany that i’m not the only complex troubled person in this dinad. John is presenting himself as stoic because that’s what i’ve asked him to do. I only whispered...because you liked it that way. 


Wednesday April 29 


Here’s a good fucking question.


Let x<y.


Michael is willing to give x% to me and only me. 


John is willing to give y% to one of many women who might love him and bear his child, and I could be one of them.


Do I want more of something anyone could have?
Or less of something rare and unique?


Also, none of it matters since it’s all in my fucking head anyway.


Curiosity killed the cat.
See, Lisa? This is what we mean when we say that you’re too smart for your own good.


I’m cleaning out the cat room so well, i proposed to you that it will be nice enough to put a sleeping bag in there for you. You squinted and asked, ‘you want me to sleep in the cat room?’ Yes, it’s such a nice space, much cooler than the shed. It’s like the room your uncle added on at your mom’s house. Yeah, that’s where you can fuck the other girls.


Who the fuck do you think you are, btw, to be stressing me out about how you love a variety of women, and the only possible tension you see btwn us is that you’re going to want to fuck other, younger, girls. Yeah? Well, fuck you. And, I fucking wish that were it. 


You are going in the opposite fucking other direction. I don’t need to worry about you fucking the younger girls!!! Are you just seriously trying to rile me up in a sex way so I’m distracted from the fact that that’s the least of my worries??? You aren’t tricking me that way. 


Your “secret” is that all you fucking want and all you ever wanted is to be a dad and have a family and be complimented by your wife and respected by her and your children and your colleagues, and do some at-worst mildly-rewarding work to support this family of yours, while proabably playing music alone in your room while realizing that maybe the baby and stepford wife isn’t actually what you wanted. I could of told you that!!! I’m telling you that right fucking now. But I don’t know you. Maybe that would make you happy. Why haven’t you gotten it yet, then???  


How did you not tell me that I’m a literal reproduction of a previous lover?? I mean, to be fair, I’m trying to duplicate all three of my other loves in you--the sweet fun musician of sean, the intense mathematician of michael, and the fucking fathering of john. You’re my chance to put all three of those failures together into one fucking last soup.  So you’re trying to fix your loss to the french man, your loss to sarah’s abortion, and your loss of feeling competent and in charge. Bam bam bam. 


Who am I to say that my dreams of us are any less self-serving than yours? I think what we have is different than those other three, and I’m sure you think so too. And if you read my journals about those men, I’m sure I’m asking them to do all the same things that I want you to do now. Just like I am for you. 


Why do I think that my requirements are more exacting than yours? I think that there are .05% of men who could satisfy me, and probably 1.5% of women could satisfy you. All they need is to be fertile and tell you that you’re worthy. That’s a fucking easy recipe. See? You don’t need ME to love you, you just need ANYBODY. Anybody who has the right fucking background and pheromone profile to make you say “I feel like I’ve known you forever and we were meant to be.” How many times can you say that to different people before it loses all its meaning and becomes trite, pedestrian, banal, and a big fucking joke on yourself? 
How many times can you tell yourself, “Oh, but this is different!” Do you SEE the things you liked about her?? They are the fucking exact same things you like about me. What happened in those 8 years? Your tastes and desires haven’t changed one bit. You tried to be thoughtful and intentional and asked what it was you loved about her so that you would know what was important to you. 


“You’re gonna have to give up on that one; it seems like she’s out to get you.” 


John john john what to do
What to do
I’m not good for you
I’m not what you want
Why don’t you know that?
So so so so so so so
Many girls would love you
And they already want to find a father for their babies
Why pick someone who doesn’t want that too?
Are you making sure that I want YOUR baby 
And not just any baby?
When that’s not true for you too?
You are so at odds with yourself. 
You want a family so badly
This rigid cold fucking thing idea you said


I’m jaded---feeling of been there done that.


Remember when you took a nap today, and i was so moved to just hold you so close and softly and gently and feel your skin and your warmth and your body, and i was thinking how sweetly i loved you and how precious you are to me, and it was so genuine and heartfilling and wonderful. I felt like i would do anything to keep that feeling. It reminded me of how i felt when i was cuddling josey. Such an unselfish love. So pure and beautiful.


But i admit--i was asking myself if i’d felt this exact feeling about michael.  Does that matter? Does it have to be the first or the last or the most to count? I mean, yeah. It does. 


If you impregnate me, and i believe that you’ve done it regardless of me and my identity, i’m going to take all that love i had for you, the love that turned to anger, and i’ll turn it back to love, and give it all to that baby. If you want to be loved, if that’s what you want the most, you should realize that you are going to get a net decrease by making me a mom.  I’ll have less love for you. The baby’s love will be for me for at least the first year. Do you want me and Iris to have to shake our heads about you the way Josey and I do about beta? 


I’ve told you that you’d be a great father; I’m sure many women have. But maybe we ought to unpack that a little more. Why? Why do we think that? 


You, like me, seem very interested in your own self-satisfaction. Are you sure that wiping someone’s snot is going to satisfy you? While your math and dick sit fallow?  Do you want to play the same games over and over and over? Do you want to stand up for three months straight because she cries if you sit down?  


Have you imagined, in your heart and soul, how you will feel when you watch me nursing our baby and knowing that you will never experience that kind of connection in your life? That seems sad for you. 


Dammit dammit dammit. 


I’m tempted to tell john i want to spend a night alone at my house. I don’t think i want that. But i’m afraid i’m sooooo under his spell. I’m not thinking clearly. Neither is he. Wait, that’s false. He is thinking clearly. He wants a smart, beautiful, curious girl who wants to be a nazi-hippie parent to his child. And he probably realizes that a regular healthy girl will not….wait...yeah. Why NOT a regular healthy girl? 


But am I doing anything worse or different than what he’s doing?


What about this.
No one ever got anywhere
No one became great
No one accomplished their goals
No one found peace


By fucking accident.


And why should WE???


We are so fucking smart;
We’re the exact people not to do that.
Tony Robbins said, 
Good efforts do not get you good rewards.
It’s so sad.
All these sad people
Saying 
I was a good man
I tried to be a good person
Why didn’t my life reward me for that?
Because…
You don’t get good rewards from being good.
Being good gets you poor rewards.
To get good rewards,
You have to be great.
You have to be smart.
And intentional. 
And we are.


Why are you trying to have a baby so haphazardly?
If you REALLY want this,
Then fucking divorce sarah
Marry me
Get me off the drugs
Give me vitamins
And do it right.
Do it on purpose.


Do you want to let things just happen to you?
Do you trust the universe to decide
With no effort from you 
Other than getting up in me?


Which of us is more confused?
Which of us has more to lose?


Why do i insist on preserving the viable spider webs when i clean
When i love the mosquito eaters so much?
Why do i maintain the mechanism 
To destroy
What i claim to love?


Or, how do i manage
Preserving two things
That are naturally at odds?


We want the baby and the love
The commitment and the freedom
The answer and the question.


I am not tied to you.
You are not tied to me.
Do we want to be?
Do we really want that?
I know i’m older than you
But i’ve asked you to know more
I’ve asked you to be trustworthy
I’ve asked you to be kind
And you said you would
But maybe i’m asking something silly.


I’m asking the fox 
“But you don’t really want to eat the sheep, do you?”
And he says, “well...ummm….[gnaw gnaw]...”
And i say
“Yeah, i don’t think you do...”
As you continue gumming the wool
And giving no response
I continue to convince myself 
What we know isn’t true
But believing is everything
And i still want you.


I’m so mad at you, john.
None of it is your fault, really.
No more than it’s mine.
We both know we’re being stupid
And hoping hopelessly for the best
As long as it still feels good
Right now. 


Do you have any conception of the
RAGE
That i would feel 
After having your baby
If you expressed even the 
Slightest
Fucking
Dissatisfaction
With this new paradigm??


I do.
I feel it bubbling up in me now.
It’s strange that i have more animus
Towards Sean than John.
John never really lied.
He never said i was so special.
In fact, he said i wasn’t.
So when we dissolved
I didn’t have to face some crisis of faith.
Like i am now. 


You’re making a terrible choice.
I’m a terrible choice
If you want a family.
You see that, right?
I see that.
Everyone sees that.
Name one person who thinks we should procreate.


Why though?
Why me?
Because i was here?


You lied when you said 
You weren’t in the mood
At this point in your life
To fall head over heels 
Because you WERE.
You always are.
That’s what you want. 


You want to fall head over heels
For a woman who tells you that you’re valuable
And that you’d be a good dad
(oh my god that’s i got you,
Isn’t it?
I bet me telling you that,
And that i wish you’d been josey’s dad,
Made you fall in love with me
Even more
Than when i suck your cock
Or tell you you’re a good catch).
Do you know that already?


But you’re not smart?
Because why would you half ass this?


Okay so i did tell you. 
I was more disappointed by your reaction than the thing
I read you aloud what you wrote
It was really beautiful
And i felt those feelings
Because you were describing them


But when i asked you what you thought
You said
You thought that i shouldn’t be
Reading your old things 
And getting jealous of old girls.


So you were mad that I snooped or whatever
And you thought 
I was jealous
Of 2012 girl.


I understand.
You were defensive
Which is fair
Because i was quoting you
Your own words and your old feelings
And you knew i was upset
So it felt like an attack. 


But...those are both so wrong.
Are you still maintaining some expectation of 
Your sacred man privacy
And i don’t get access to all of you
b/c 
Well...why? 
That cheapens it? Or you? 
That privacy keeps me from usurping your whole identity?


But I don’t want to do that
And you fucking DO WANT ME TO DO THAT!
How can you look at me and cry and tell me
With all your sincerity
That all you want is to be loved
(doesn’t that imply completely?
Doesn’t that imply loving your whole self
And not just what you wanna grant me access to??)
And then be annoyed or offended or violated or embarrassed
Or whatever you were
By my reading your journal??


And HOW
HOW
HOW
Can you think
That I am JEALOUS
Of some girl of your past?


DO YOU REALLY THINK MY FEARS ARE SO MUNDANE????        


I mean, honestly, fuck you. 


You want me to give you my whole fucking future???
My body
My freedom
My time
My whole fucking life


And you’re going to make a fuss
About your privacy 
Or me being jealous
About nothing???


What makes me jealous is you holding things back.
Do you want me holding back? 
Do you want to be getting to know
My curated version of myself
That is not 
The whole thing??


You know we need context to understand things.
Don’t you want it too? 


Next time I’m annoyed with you
I’m going to walk away from you
When you want to kiss me
And that’s exactly how the fuck it happened
With beta.


I remember where i was
And how i felt
And the exact thought. 
I’m sitting at the kitchen table
And he’s “gotta go”
Or he’s finally back,
And I look at him,
And I smile,
Or I ask for a kiss,
And I get nothing. 


I don’t know how many times that happened
Before i got pissed off
And gave up
And said
Okay.
If you don’t fucking smile at me
If you don’t fucking kiss me
When I offer that to you,
Then i’m gonna fucking stop caring.


Walk out the door.
Don’t say goodbye to your fucking daughter.
Don’t kiss the woman you bizarrely
And stupidly
Chose to bear her. 


I thought to myself,
One day he’s gonna miss this
And he’s gonna be sorry
That he didn’t appreciate it
When he had it. 


“Think 
while you still have me
Move
while you still see me
You'll be lost, 
and you'll be sorry 
when I'm gone!!!”


Just like jesus.
Except it wasn’t all clean and connected and logical.
He didn’t see that he gave that love away
Or i was too focused on those smiles and kisses.
But when it was gone,
I don’t think he knew why.
I thought I did, 
But how real is that.


Even after John and I talked, 
He was annoyed
When I reminded him
That I had mentioned
When totally fucking cleaning the cat room
That it would be so clean
That he could put his sleeping bag in there.


Why didn’t he appreciate my call back
To the traditional husband/wife trope
Of the man being in the doghouse,
When he had previously employed it
To his humor
To accuse me of nagging him?
That’s not fair or equitable. 


Of course he’s sensitive.
I am too.
I can dish it out
But I can’t take it.
So I guess it’s okay if he’s the same way
But don’t we need to know it??


I offered you a quarantini
And you said nope 
Not in the mood
But then i guess
Felt bad
And offered
That you were just uploading 
Some stuff you’d already done
And were not going to be
Involved deep and long.


I said,
Yeah,
I wasn’t TRYING
To make any kind of CLAIM
On your time
(you’ll know when i do)
I was just 
Offering 
To make you 
A fucking drink.


Also, after our “fight”
You conceded,
“At least you’re taking me seriously.”


WHAT???
About what??
Since when!??


When did you think I wasn’t taking you and this whole thing SO FUCKING SERIOUSLY!!!???


You thought I was just using you for kicks?
Is that what beta-sophy did?
Is that what you’re doing??


Until now you weren’t sure??
You want to knock up a girl
That you don’t want to read your past thoughts
That you’re not sure is serious
For why??
For what??


You say you’re smart
I believe you’re smart
So why are you not acting smart??


You know that we’re not.
You know we’re being dumb.
If you really want a baby with me
Then decide it
And say it
And do it.


Don’t put your head down and wait for what comes. 
That’s what I want to do.
Don’t make me be in charge.
Don’t make me be the one.
I’m sick of it. 
I want you to be smart.
I want to trust you.
I don’t want to second guess your decisions
And realize again
That i’m the one 
Who has to do the hard fucking thinking,
Recognize the harsh reality
Put on the brakes
And feel like a fucking enemy of love.


I told you,
If you want to do something well,
You need to plan it
And be smart.


If you really want a baby with me
And a life with me
Then fucking divorce sarah
Marry me
Get me off the drugs
And do it the right way. 


Or, if this is just a hot fantasy,
Maybe we should be more careful?


I think it’s weird that you have not read the document i shared with you.
Are you not interested in my secrets
Or knowing more about me?
What if i said important things in there?
Things that would change your course if you knew them?


What if i said I’ve secretly been on the pill
This whole time
And just fucking 
With your fantasies
Of having a baby?


I’d be fucking smarter than i am,
For one thing. 


No way you’re getting free sex tonight
Nope at all
You’re gonna have to rape me
If you want it.


I am disappointed.
Disappointed.
You are too defensive
You don’t trust me
You’re not all in
You don’t know what you want
You fear something 
That you don’t know what
And it’s interfering 
With our closeness.


Maybe you already fucking know you don’t want me?
And you’re just riding me out until quarantine is over?
 
That’s fucking fine
No problem at all
You can even trick me
Into thinking it’s forever
Cause maybe that’s what i
(you)
Need now,
But don’t fucking try to get me pregnant 
At that same time!!!


We can be quarantine lovers
Without growing old together.
You don’t have to completely
rescind/abscond/deny
What we’re doing now
Just because you don’t want it forever.


PLUS
I never did!
You’re the one who did!
You’re the one enticing me into some WHOLE THING
That i didn’t want or need
And that i told you
Would NEVER
NEVER work
Because I’ve already tried 
With all my heart
And all my values
And all my faith,
And it didn’t “work”


And it’s super fucked up of you
To try and convince me that this could
When you don’t even know what you want 
Anyway!
You said,
“Maybe you shouldn’t be reading my private stuff
If it’s going to make you get jealous.”
But...but...but…


I was trying to offer you to be so open with me.
I understand it’s hard
And it takes a while 
To trust someone new


But you’re not supposed
To fuck them over
And discount their sincerity
Just because YOU
Haven’t begun
To trust them yet.


You see???
I don’t know what game you’re playing
Sure you want to be loved
While also having your space
And your secret fucking self
And your “variety of women”


But why are you telling me that
And i’m saying sure
And then you’re still
Fucking hassling me
When you’re the one
Who wants this intermingling 
MOST?


I was fucking fine on my own.
Michael was some kind of dumbo magic flying feather
But not a real thing, i fear.
I had nothing real
So i need nothing real
And i don’t care if you’re real or no
But don’t try to sell me some fucking story
And then blame me for believing it. 


Thursday April 30 midnight (i.e., afternoon)










  



I was thinking about my claim that I’m never trying to be mean to you (so you should stop jumping to the conclusion that when I say something about you it’s bound to be negative), and you said it’s not always true, or at least not true that everything I say is sweet and supportive. But it is. Even if I’m expressing some way that I’m dissatisfied, that is exactly sweet and supportive of our relationship. You have that same goal, to not build resentments by keeping negative feelings inside. Trust takes time to build, and lord knows i’ve told you that i have no control of my emotions and they can change in a heartbeat and there’s nothing I can do. But that’s true of everyone. We can’t promise each other that we’ll never fall out of love, but we can promise to always be kind and to work to improve our relationship up until the point we abandon it. We don’t need the long decline. Please don’t be cold to me. I think I’ve been able to make up with every boy hugging and kissing him. Well, Michael and Sean never got mad at me, and I didn’t care to comfort beta. So I’m not sure who I’m speaking of--maybe you. Maybe I’m just so sure it should work with you. And then when I try it, and you walk away from me, i feel like you’ve defused my greatest power! Well...I guess I used to think my kisses and sweetness were my greatest power, but with you it’s the cock worship. But if I couldn’t stop you from walking away from my kiss, how would I get your cock out? And you admitted that you weren’t really angry with me about my “you can sleep in the cat room now that I’ve cleaned it,” but it just came at the wrong time when you were already in a bad mood for you didn’t know why (still mad at your boner? But we had such a sweet cuddle!). You admitted that it wasn’t a meaner joke than when you talked about me nagging, and they’re both just call backs to the stereotypical bitch wife who puts her husband in the doghouse. 


But. But. But. 


I think I need to tell you this. 
When you get defensive
And cold
And think i’m being mean
Or invasive
And instinctively withdraw,


Your whole “thing” changes
I can see it on your face
And in your eyes
And i can feel it in your energy
And your breath
And your stance


And i feel like everything changes
I don’t know you at all
You think you don’t know me
You close the door on me
And it’s the worst feeling.
I hate it.


It’s like my love has suddenly lost its power
To make you feel good
And i’m not sure i’ll ever get it back
And i can’t believe it can be gone so easily
And it’s scary
And it feels awful
And it makes me want to give up.


If you’re not giving me an all access pass to you
Then i don’t want it
I don’t want curated john
Or defensive john
Or self-preserving john
Or afraid-of-a-broken-heart john.


Everyone knows that won’t work. 
Your safety gear gets in the way
Of the whole process
And you achieve nothing
And plus??
Guess plus what else?


It’s TOO LATE.
It’s too fucking late for you to protect your heart
From getting broken by me. 
It’s too late for me too.
Why even worry about something that’s either inevitable,
Or will never happen? 


Can you think of one way
That this could end between us
And it not break your heart?
And mine?


You said you were less disillusioned
When you wrote those things about courtney
And maybe you believed more was possible
Or didn’t realize so much else was possible






Maybe you’re like Josh--”I promise you, I’m just not thinking about it all that much!”


We’re not happy because things are good
Things are good for us
Because we’re so happy.


So maybe all of these ups and downs
Aren’t really life, or john,
But just in my mind.


I mean, obviously
Other people suffer 
REAL ups and downs
But i don’t think that’s what mine are.
I consider my situation
And it’s so good
It meets, i think
