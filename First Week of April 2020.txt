Wednesday April 1
My Job Interview


It’s remarkable how quickly it happened; such little time and such little input was required for me to develop a flinch reflex to John’s approach. I suppose that makes me smart. A quick learner.


What happened tonight??
I have no idea.


I was sure he was trying to talk me out of this.
But he says he was trying to give me what I wanted.


I see how it’s tricky.
I see how what I’m asking for is equivalent to what I’m asking not for.
He’s just trying things out.
So am I.


He shouldn’t have been so harsh.
But maybe he should have.


I absolutely questioned my commitment to the project
My interpretation of my desires
While i was tied up in his back seat.


I had so many ideas of where he was taking me
I didn’t like any of them
I didn’t feel like he liked me
I didn’t think i was turning him on
I was terrified
And unsure
And powerless


And i asked myself, 
Isn’t this what i asked for?
What is he possibly about to do to me that I did not explicitly invite him to do?
Kill me?
Did I push the wrong button?
Did I push the wrong guy?
Did I push my case too hard?

Do I care or do I don’t?
I don’t know.
I was afraid when he put me down in the middle of the road
It was paved
And it was so close to the busy road
I didn’t understand what was happening
I didn’t want to get run over
I didn’t want to get left out there


I was so cold.
It was only a coincidence that I was so lightly dressed
It was the interview outfit he said i should wear.
He put it down on the dirty asphalt
And his dirty floor that I haven’t cleaned yet
And he told me it wasn’t professional;
That it was like ...


He said he wants to share a life with me???!!!
Why would he say that?
Why would he say that now?
It’s just that i’m asking him for his love
And then during the tenderest part of the sex
When he was kissing me so gently on my legs
(the calf with the marks
From my favorite bread slicer
That I stole when he left
Cause it means more to me)
And that was the most painful part of the sex
And i wonder why
Did it reveal a truth?
Or reveal a lie? 


He says i don’t need to save the tab
For the suicide hotline 
That didn’t answer
But look at me now.


Only walrus saved me
She meowed and meowed at me not to 
But john was sleeping
I’m already alone
He’s already not enough
I’m asking too much
I’m never satisfied.


He told me he wants to share a life with me??
How is that not satisfying to me???
What do I even want?

I want him to stay up all night hitting me until i beg him to stop
And then immediately miss it?


I’m too easy to break
And too easy to fix


Neither state lasts.
I guess that’s adaptable, 
But it’s hard to believe in.


I asked him for time to write and process my thoughts
And then wondered why i needed to process them myself
Before sharing with him
I know i’m self reliant
But am i dependent on that?
Is it the best way?


Maybe I’m just using him for things to write about.
What if he offered me all this and more
At the cost that i couldn’t write it down.
Then would the pain be worth it?


Oh...I thought I was looking for relief of pain,
Not addition of pain.
Maybe i’m just looking for addition of stimulus
And my brain is such
And my culture is such
That this seems like the easiest/obvious/best choice.


Define “best,” please.
While you’re at it, also define
Love,
Forever, and
Meaning 


I was so scared when he put me down on the road
Was it worth it?
Are these words worth it?
Or the feelings?
Or the thoughts?


Let’s be honest:
I don’t care if anyone reads this
I don’t care if my ”book” gets famous
I just want my life to be something
That I think is worth writing about.


I want things to happen to me
That give me things to think about 
And want to remember.
The sweetest thing he said
Was when i asked him 
How he’d feel if my book got famous
And he was more known for 
His part in my life
Than his own


And he said he wouldn’t mind
Because he would
Just be so happy for me
And proud of me
That my book was a success.


I just really didn’t expect him to say that at all
I didn’t even secretly want it
It surprised me as much as his kick to my head
And it felt as strong
And i promise i don’t know the difference
Between those feelings


One is pain right now that will end soon
And the other is untold possible pain in the future
That i invite in by perceiving these
Feelings as pleasure when 
I can clearly see right now
That those gentle kisses on my legs
Hurt just as very much
As the fourth whip on my neck


But not as much
As the second time 
He set me down on the street
And taped my eyes
And walked away.


When he put me back in the car after that
I was so afraid.
So afraid
When i heard the door open,
That he was changing his mind again
And would put me back out there


I wanted to fight to stay inside
But i was tied so tight.
My hands were numb
And my ankles were throbbing
And i had no underwear on
Because i wanted to be sexy when he got there


But now the freeway wind was freezing my ass
And i don’t even think he cared.
He said my outfit wasn’t professional;
That it looked like someone 
Someone over 40 would wear
Going to some event
Trying to get laid.
Yeah fuck you too.
You’ll be over 40 and you’ll see
You have more power and opportunity than you do now
It’s not something for me to feel ashamed of 
Or him to be scared of 
But it was a really mean thing to say to me. 
After he’d already seen that dress
And told me it was good interview outfit.


And he wouldn’t give me a smoke
Or a drink
Or talk to me.
Or tell me where we were going


I noticed that the ride was taking extra long
I noticed because he was smoking a cigarette
And the wind through the open window was freezing my exposed ass and pussy
And i keep thinking we must be almost there,
And which turn is he making now?
And why is he going so fast on these roads?


So I worked myself into an upright position
And i could see we were past his house
We were headed south,
Out of town.


I had asked him 
(unfortunately in retrospect, told him)
That i needed to stay home,
But his home would have been good too
But now he was taking me somewhere
I didn’t know,
Unsafe,
And far away and cold and without his protection.


I looked at him for a while through the front seats
I thought how handsome he looked
And strong and determined
And i wondered what he was thinking
And i hoped it was good
But i slowly realized it wasn’t
And then i turned my head into the back seat.


And we drove and we drove
And i was cold and i was cold
And I told him I didn’t even have any shoes on
And he wouldn’t answer me
And i started to think maybe i was in over my head
That I didn’t understand him
That he didn’t understand me


But why should he? 
I told him i had no limits
But i also told him i only wanted to do it if was sexy to me
How should he know?


I couldn’t show my submission with position #2
Because of how he had tied me.
My ankles hurt
And my wrists hurt
And i was thirsty
And my lips were dry
And i was so cold
And the ground was rough
And the street was dangerous
And i didn’t know if he cared.
I didn’t know if was paying attention
Or remembering
Or caring. 


What if he was incompetent like the rest of them?
What if he didn’t MEAN for me to get run over?
What if he was planning to run me over?
That’s not a sexy way to die.


And I really don’t want him to get in trouble.
Even if he goes overboard,
It’s not his fault.
Our limits are vague.
He’s not a doctor.


He said he’ll research how to be safe,
Like he did before,
And then forgot.
But i really don’t care.
I just want him to recognize
And appreciate my sacrifices.


I don’t like that i’m making him feel bad
When he gives me what i want
Or what he thinks i want.


I’m glad it’s sexy in retrospect. 
The train tracks were perfect.
It was what i asked for
It was scary 
And real 
And painful 
And new
And surprising
And i loved the power he was showing me
And the care he showed me after.


But tonight was different.
It wasn’t for me or for him.
Or maybe it was.


He said he won’t do it again
But now he also knows 
How to frighten me
For real. 


Why does he think i’m trying to make him angry?
I might be trying to incite him, excite him,
Invite him to push his limits
To show him that he doesn’t need to ask me
He can make me
And i want him to
But making him angry isn’t part of that
I don’t want to do that.


I just want to challenge him 
And show him how brave i am
And that i’ll withstand anything to bring him pleasure
But if it doesn’t bring him pleasure…
If he’s just doing this for me…


I want to say it’s unnecessary,
That if he wants me,
Just wants me in the regular way
To love and cherish
He can have that from me in an instant.
He’s earned it/me
He seduced me so hard
He’s impressed me so hard
He’s made me reach new apecies trying to impress him.


But…
I thought he needed me to play hard to get
I thought he wouldn’t want me if I wanted him for keeps
And that’s true
We’re all contradictory
But is he saying now he does want me?
That i’ve landed him?
That he sees how valuable i can be to his life?


But will i?
Will I become complacent just like i’m afraid he will over these two months?
Will we keep raising the ante
And say the life i have with you
Isn’t enough for me anymore
I want something 
New and different and exciting 
Again.


Oh my god i didn’t bring that up.
I told him my fantasy, 
My dark fantasy,
About him forcing me to wait tied up in his house
While he goes out to seduce another girl
Which i know he can
And would do it not so much to impress me
(which it does)
But to satisfy his desire for new pussy
Which mine no longer is.


I tell him, 
And i believe,
That those experiences will only make him want me more
Appreciate me more,
Sigh and think of them, 
“Is that all you’ve got?”


But what if? 
What if?
What if one time it’s someone like me, or him, who offers more,
Is better,
And earns him away.
That should be okay.
Why this struggle again?


I love him
I value him
I respect him
I want him to be happy
I want him to be the happiest
But only if it’s because of me.


I don’t want him to be happier without me
I’d want him to be less happy
That’s mean.
I’m mean. And selfish.
No.
I just want impossible assurances.
Opa loved Oma forever.
They had the war
We have the virus
It will bond us forever
Until one of us dies
And leaves the other bereft.


There’s no good end.
No reward for a life well lived
I’ve seen that.
We all die alone
(except those of us lucky enough to find a worthy death partner
Which so far I am not.)


What is he really offering me?????
What am i really offering him???
What do we even have right
Knowledge
Or capability 
To offer each other?


I will give you my best 
As long as you make me want to.


That’s what I keep saying.
And I tell him exactly how to do it
If only he could read my mind.


I guess i can’t read his. 
We just need more practice.
He said he was sorry for tonight.
He admitted that he overreacted.
That he misunderstood my intentions.
That he wouldn’t do it again.


But now I know precisely that he could.
Him doing it and apologizing 
Is not proof that he won’t do it.
It’s proof that he will.


Is that what i wanted?
Is that what he was showing me
b/c he thought/knew i wanted that?
I guess i did.


Will he really think it’s sexy in retrospect?
Will I?


I guess I want to be humiliated only on my terms. 
It seems like a clear distinction to me. 
Only do it if it turns you on
Makes you feel powerful and manly
Expresses the depth of my commitment


Not to make me feel like i don’t please you.
I want to be corrected
I want to be punished
But only because you 
Want me to do better
Not because you think i’m against you
Or because you don’t want me
Or because you don’t respect me
Or because i’ve hurt you.


I never mean to hurt you
Unless i’m just childishly 
Trying to communicate 
That you’ve hurt me. 


I usually have such good instincts with him
I know what he wants
(When he asked my why i wanted this position,
When i’d finally won back the chance to interview,
I asked if he meant he wanted to see my presentation. 
He asked if my presentation answered that question,
And my secret special mind told me the answer:
“I want the position because i love you.”
And it was so true
And so right
And so good
And i am so grateful for knowing it 
And feeling it)
But now I had no idea how to appease him
I didn’t know why he was so angry
I didn’t know what he was planning
I had so many scary thoughts


But if he was going to kill me 
I thought it was okay. 
I guess that’s what I’ve asked him for
Essentially.
Save me or kill me.
It’s gotta be you or me.
And if you do it it’s probably a lot more exciting
And a better story
And not so sad
And maybe even sexy
But i’m starting to doubt
That last part.
I thought about all the dirty fantasies I’ve offered
And requested,
And asked myself if I really wanted them.
At least not this way
Not unless we were in on it together.
I just want to have a deal with someone.
Like a contract 
That i’ll be your #1
If you’ll be mine.
Why’s that so weird or wrong to want??


I told him that I didn’t think I could compete
With the basic bitches 
At their basic bitch skills
So instead of trying and failing
I looked for a different path
And realized that the special kind of guys i like
Appreciate that approach.
So I cultivated that
But maybe i’m still a little sad
That i can’t be a regular lady wife
For a happy good successful guy
Who wants to cuddle his lady
Instead of slap her hard.


Am I afraid my cuddling isn’t good enough?
No no no
That’s not right at all.
No guy has rejected me because I was 
Lacking in basic bitch skills.


They’re all happy to pick up my slack;
Cook the food and clean the house.
So what’s wrong?
Why isn’t that good enough?


John is so good.
He could be happy with anyone
(maybeeee)
And I want a good guy like that.
I deserve a deep challenging interesting special guy
But not one of the ineffective-at-life ones.
A functional special guy is really hard to come by.
Plenty of women will love john because he’s so functional
And wouldn’t even notice he’s so special.


He says that i’m 100% the best thing that came 
Out of him moving here.
He doesn’t believe that things happen for a reason
Because they don’t
But if they did
We both want to believe we were brought together.


He says he’s afraid he’s going to take me away
From my protected forest
And i’ll either wither
Or hate him.


But where does he want to take me?
What does he offer in exchange?
Yes I’m content here
But am I not asking to be saved??


Does the princess not want to be whisked away to the castle (in Italy)?
But am I really going to keep him happy?
I can’t be disappointed again.
Not again.
(link to Paul coming in second
For the second time 
On Big Brother,
Looking down, shaking his head, mouthing over and over,
“Not again. Not again.”
The thing is that it happened for the same fucking reason.
As Julie cuttingly observed
“Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.”
Bc he did the same thing again
He betrayed people 
And then didn’t own up to it.


What am i doing again?
What am i going to do again to make john realize
I’m not as good as
Initially presented?


Am I overconfident?
I told him I think I’m smarter than him
He said he doesn’t think i’m smarter than him
I don’t want him to think that
But i want him to think he has to compete
And of course we can both excel at different things
But i just want him to be impressed by how smart i am
And also show that he really is smarter
But i’m the smartest closest a girl could get. 


Am I misrepresenting myself?
Am I a bait and switch?
I never said I wasn’t high maintenance
I’m a high performance girl
And guys are supposed to love tinkering
To get the settings just right. 


Later, after the presentation,
I gave him my final argument:
I kneeled on the ground in position #2
And presented my bare openings to him
And offered me and them with my whole heart
Because I knew that’s what he wanted.


And I did that freely even after he’d 
Almost just left me in the road. 
He said he tied me with my hands in front
Instead of behind
So i could get out of them
But i couldn’t have.
I couldn’t have anyway.
But i did appreciate that he wore his nice dress shoes
And didn’t kick me with them. 


But i’m afraid it’s not enough.
He’s been loved before
I’ve loved before
It’s never been him and me.


I tried to be so honest with myself
For him
And i told him that all i wanted was to 
Believe i was special
And for someone i believed in
To affirm it.


And he didn’t. 
He just said nothing.
Maybe he was falling asleep.
Maybe was unimpressed by claim that i’m smarter than all the computers


So i had to backtrack
I had to rely on myself again
I said nevermind
I don’t need you to tell me i’m special
I already believe it
And i’m just offering to share that with you
And if you don’t recognize that as a fucking special gift
Then off with you.


But maybe he doesn’t want to always feel
Like he’s so lucky to have me.
Just barely worthy of me.
But that’s how i want to feel about him.
I want to feel so so so lucky to have him
(and I do
If i do)
Even if it means him reaffirming 
That he can win plenty of girls
Even if stings me a lot
Like i told him it would


Why don’t people care about my pain?
When I tell them how to save me from it,
They do the opposite.
If i say
“Please do not do this.
It will hurt me.
I do not want this.
This is exactly the worst thing you could do to me.”
They do it.
With little to no fanfare.


And if I say,
“I’m in pain,
And i don’t think i can take it,
And i would love for you to save me,
By doing this.”
And they don’t. 


In both cases they pretend not to notice what they’ve done.
Why did he ask why i was kicking my feet?


I don’t know if i’m in more pain now
Or less.
At least it’s something to think about
And not the virus.


I ensured that our contract included a disfigurement clause
--it’s not included with chromic pain or disability--
It’s allowed
--and i hope he recognized, welcomed--
Because if something is important,
Don’t you want something to remember it by?
Some evidence?
TIme heals all wounds, but slowly, and maybe not for the best.


My back really hurts.
I don’t know if it’s from how i was tied
Or being hit
Or lying on my stomach typing.
Certainly bolth.


He said he feels he ought not 
To ask me about michael.


I want our relationship to be about us
And not michael


But he’s part of me
My past and my present
As much as i want to forget
The pain will resurface
Like sean has lately.


Maybe I wait to grieve one love
Until after the next one has ended.


Thank god for John, though.
He has protected my heart from michael
As much as one could 


If it weren’t for him,
If i had been left all alone,
I couldn't have lived with it. 
It breaks my heart that Michael could.

Would he be sorry now,
If he saw what alternative I’ve chosen?
How bereft he’s left me
That this is what i need to be satisfied?


It’s not their fault.
I’m not in my right mind.
It’s no one’s job to save me.
But then why do I keep wanting the job of saving them?


I told John I couldn’t bear to be a failed muse again.
I can’t let him down.
He can’t let me down.


When I was in the car,
I really did question my commitment
Can I really prove my conjecture?
I don’t know...no one ever knows
But I believe I can
And I’m going to try until I can’t
Or he doesn’t want me to anymore. 


I don’t know how this all happened.
So many things at once
Such a complicated recipe
So unlikely
So unexpected
So good or so bad?
Why do I always have to decide that??

Can’t it just be?
Don’t I like things that happen
Instead of things that don’t happen?
Well I don’t know.


Maybe I’m sick of things happening
And I want to pick one last thing to happen
And then not have to worry anymore.


John keeps asking 
Who’s using whom
And who is taking advantage of the other
But why does it have to be that way?


We’re both vulnerable now.
Why can’t we be saving each other
Instead of using each other?
Because that’s unrealistic?
Because it gives our agency away
And makes us depend on the other?


I promise I didn’t want to get attached to you!!!
I was happy enough how I was
Maybe like how you were happy enough
But I guess you wanted this


You tried so hard to make me fall in love with you.
Maybe you tried harder because I assured you 
It wouldn’t work.
Everyone loves to work their charms
But then you have to deal with the consequences.


I specifically said, 
Let’s do this,
“Consequences be damned.”
Okay.
How now to damn them??


I guess I was saying I was 
Open to anything?
And so were you?
Are you still?
Are you more?


Do I want more violence
Or just more love 
And more intensity?


Maybe you can show me
Other ways to feel it.


It’s just so immediate
So devoted
So all-encompassing
So finite
So simple (in ways).


Maybe the only reason 
I try so hard to convince you i’m so special
Is because i want to make you feel
SO SPECIAL
That of everyone
I picked you. 


I’m not satisfied by regular guys
By boring guys
By guys who are easily satisfied by me.
I want to satisfy you,
That my greatest want
But i want to work for it
I don’t want to do it 
With one hand tied behind my back
(I mean, I do)
Because I want to show you
That I’m working for you


That I am not trying to placate you
With occasional 
Gooey sentiments
Because i know you love them


But i don’t want to do that
Just because you want it
But BECAUSE I know how much you want it
I want you to know
That I really really really really
Mean it
When i do.
I don’t want phone calls that end with 
“Love you”
“Love you too.”
I mean I guess that’s sweet
If that’s your baseline
But then don’t you have to up the ante?


Does the millionth 
“I love you”
Mean as much as the first?
More??


I feel alone right now
I wish you were awake with me
Or i were asleep with you
But i also need my alone time
As do you
But it seems a little more alone
Compared to being with you.


I don’t feel alone
Because i’m thinking about you
And how to love you
And how to let you make me happy


And maybe you’ll read this
And you’ll think it’s nice
Or that you understand me more
Or that i understand you more.


I just want us to dig and dive
Until there’s only nakedness
And acceptance
And trust
And some sort of forever peace.


Maybe we’re scared we won’t like each other deep down
Or the mystery will fade
Or the expectations will be unfulfilled
And we will despair again
But have beautiful memories
And not horrible ones
Like you keep saying i’m giving you
Maybe i’m not picking up
On how much you’re trying to give to me.


Here I am telling you that i’m willing to do all kinds of things
To prove to you that I’m here for you
But i’m assuming
That everything you’re doing 
Is because it pleases you.


Like the contract says.
My pleasure is serendipitous


Consciousness is a byproduct of entropy
An unconscious consequence
Like stardust
Beautiful
Ephemeral
Meaningless but to those cursed with consciousness
And a perverse need to find meaning.


Maybe the reason I think I’m smarter than you
Is because you seem so capable of 
Being happy.
I love that about you,
I admire it,
I want you to teach it to me


But i also think 
That no one can be happy
And also insightful enough
To understand
What’s not going on.


This isn’t a good evolutionary trick.
To make us suffer to an untimely death.
I promise you this though.
If you make me pregnant,
I will INSTANTLY
Love that baby more than you
In ways you could never understand
And your dick will become 
A filthy abomination
That i don’t want anywhere near
Me and my baby.
Thursday April 2
Best day ever
Followed by worst day ever
So ups and downs


But let me reconsider
Let me challenge the assumptions that i hold onto so strongly.
Madame Teresa told me 
That i don’t have to apply 
Lessons learned 
By other men disappointing me
Onto you.


These are not similar cases.
The results will not be the same.


I can imagine cradling that baby
While john cradles me
And we both gaze at our baby
And gaze into each other eyes
And feel a completely new level
Of awe and joy
And what our love has created.


I’m going to hold onto that possibility
I’m going to believe it would have happened that way
I can almost feel it
I can almost imagine us there
Maybe the dmt will let me see what
Might have been.


I’m rapidly turning rabid for you.
You said you needed to get your emotions in check
That you’re so fond of me.
But now you’ve pierced my seal
And made me feel safe enough
To let my emotions grow unrestrained
To even encourage them
And relish them
And luxuriate in how right and good and safe
It feels 
To love you freely and completely (infinitely)
And let you know it.


I want to send you the biggest box
And inside is the biggest heart
I’ve ever had
You made it so big
That i have so much extra to give to you


You did ask me to try to melt you with my love
And drench you with my desire


And i amazedly said,
“I did it! I really did it!” 


But wow oh wow
When i look back now
I was just beginning!
I learned your alphabet
And thought I was fluent.


But now I’m at that stage
(which can frustrate intermediate learners)
Where I know enough
To begin to comprehend
How much more there is to know.


The language learners are frustrated because they want to be fluent now;
The amount left to learn
Seems daunting and insurmountable
And the gains are now small
Compared to effort spent.


Oh but that’s now what it’s like for me!
I’m at the intermediate level of loving you
And I’m so proud of all I’ve learned
And I’m so excited to learn more
So excited by the sense
That there’s SO much more
For us to enjoy about each other
And about life
Together. 


So many more ways I can learn to make you happy
And make you love me
And make you feel more loved than you’ve ever felt
Or imagined you could feel.


We’re helping each other discover the unknown
Mechanisms that neuroscientists
Are seeking.


It’s really just like math.
We have ideas
We try some things out
We see how they work
We try some other things
We maybe get a little frustrated in the middle?
Maybe we might ought to prepare
For a slump
And have plan to deal with it
To remind ourselves of 
Primacy of the project
And recommit.
Might not happen,
But we should plan for the best and prepare for the worst too


But oh how good it feels when you figure it out!!!
When you see how it all fit together
And the piece you were missing
And now it all makes sense
And you either wonder why you didn’t see it before
Or you marvel at how you arrived at such insight.


I want to ask you the questions 
That you wish i would ask
I really do want to therapize you!
(therapize your cock)
I want to phallo-analyze you
I want to integrate you 
So you make all the sense
And see the biggest picture
And understand your place in it
And feel happy and confident and joyous
At where you find yourself
And what it means 


I think about all the times in my life
I said wistfully, longingly, and sadly,
“I wish I had someone to…
motivate me
Inspire me 
Believe in me
Encourage me
Support me
Go there with me
Do that with me
Try this together
Learn things together
Be brave together


And i can’t believe that i finally really do.
I loved doing yoga in the yard with you
I loved it so much
You were so encouraging
You made me feel like i was doing so well
And made me want to keep doing it
And impress you
With how strong and flexible
You can make me
And that i don’t hate it
I just needed someone to hold my hand
And show me how
And care about how i do. 


Oh my god.
I am so turned on right now
My desire keeps bubbling up and 
Has nowhere to go 
And i have to groan out loud
And tighten all up
To let it out
For a moment
Until i remember
Another thing
That’s we’ve done
Or will
Or might
Do. 


And then it rises up again stronger than the last time


Oh my god. 
My wrist aches from writing 100 times (well 110)
“John sees that Sophy is the most beautiful wildflower in all   


John is so fun
I have so much fun with him
Everything seems exciting




Friday April 3


________________


THE NEXT FUCKING DAY


I knew it wasn’t real 
I knew it was too good to last
I always know
I knew better than to believe again


I guess i hate you most for that
For giving me one last big disappointment
Did i forget to put “hope” in the contract?


You should tell yourself,
“Oh, i guess she had more issues than i thought!”
“Geez...she told me she was a relatively healthy mental sex slave”
“Typical woman...she says she wants something, i do my shitty best to give it to her, and then she’s not happy? She didn’t appreciate my arm around her?”
And probably not add this part
“... as she poured her own fucking whisky cup THAT WAS IN THE CONTRACT THAT I WOULD PROVIDE after TWELVE HOURS of leaving her fucking alone to her own thoughts and not giving her the massage she earned, and not watching a show with her like a regular couple--nope, I’ll skip straight ahead to the sorry honey i’m so sleepy phase”


...and I fucking let it go, and I stayed up all my byself all fucking night not even hurting myself, and writing all kind of sincere but now ruined shit about how much i love you and how much i appreciated you saving me, and i was so excited at my idea, and i knew how much you would love reading them when you found them, and then i came to bed and i loved you, and then in the morning you came to me for sex and that was nice...and then you left me. You fucking left me alone all day long. Where was my milk? Where was my lemonade? Where was some water or food or coffee? Where was the massage i earned? Have you yet fullfilled your six hours of attention to your devotee ONCE of only two fucking days we’ve had??? NO!!!


I did everything I could to make you happy yesterday. It was such a happy day, even though i poured boiling water on my hand while i was making you coffee and you never noticed. I noticed it. I noticed it when the sun made it sting while we were outside hanging up your laundry, and tonight in the bath when the hot water made it burn and I could have killed myself 100 times over while you were doing i don’t know what. Feeling happy because you thought i was gonna love you for free?


When I locked the bathroom door and stayed in there in the dark for an hour with the water running, and you didn’t even check on me. After hours and hours of you ignoring me. ARE YOU STUPID? I thought for sure you’d slap me when i suggested that. 


I thought that was your biggest fear. It’s mine too. 


I even just wanted somebody that i valued who would even care if i died, who would just put in the smallest interventions to keep me alive. Even if they only wanted me alive so they could fuck me. But you never checked on me. You never brought me water. The only water in the bedroom was the water that I had gotten for you when you were sleeping and i was up all night telling steph and doug how i’d never been happier and i finally thought i’d found someone who valued me and wanted everything from me. I guess you do...but i thought the deal was that you were also going to take care of me, and not just leave me all alone.


I’m sorry, John. You should be sorry too. You just want someone to love you. You don’t want me to force me to love you. But then why did you make me think that? Why didn’t you just tell me that a regular version of me was good enough for you, and then I didn’t need to try so hard to offer you something that none of the regular girls would? Why didn’t you just say that you wanted me? Probably because you don’t. Even with me offering you the things that I think are the most i have to offer, it’s not enough. What do you want the most????? Why are you not telling me?? Is it because you don’t think i can give it to you?


I really believed in you, John. I really, really, really did. But I didn’t need this. If you just wanted me regular, and made me believe it, I would have done that. But you said you didn’t want that! You told me you didn’t want it. And I already agreed that regular relationships don’t work, and I thought if I offered you this kind of special thing it would work...but also i don’t mean that--i really didn’t need you until you made me need you. That just makes this even more terrible and more worse...maybe i should have flown to michael! He would ignore me and take me for granted too. What’s the difference? He’s spent twelve fucking years on me, and I blew him off because he DISAPPOINTED me, and you said that you wouldn’t, John. You told me that you would appreciate me in a way that he doesn’t, didn’t you??? Didn’t you? Why would I give you more for the same amount of keeping me in the background???
That’s what fucking Beta John did too. The father of my actual child. He just wanted to do his Man Music Cock thing out in the world, with the security of an ignored woman and child in the background. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT???


I dreamed this night that we had a baby. I had already been pregnant, and the baby came before we knew about it. It was only 20 weeks old, but it survived. I can’t remember what came after. I don’t think it was good, but maybe it wasn’t worse than this.


Do you see now why I told Beta that Doug’s songs were more important to me than he was?
Do you see now why I told you that I wouldn’t give up drugs for you?
Because he let me down, and you let me down, and songs and drugs don’t.


If you’re sitting there on some high horse thinking that I’m all fucked up
Let me remind you
That all i wanted was to offer you what every decent girl wants to offer every decent man
And i tried to add in so much fucking more
Because i thought i had more to give
And i thought you wanted me to give more


But apparently you just want some fucking regular 
Boring fucking easily satisfied woman
Who will sleep in your bed 
And love you
While you ignore the fuck out of her.


You thought you’d get that out of me?
After one fucking day of our contract??


John, I am so disappointed.
I still think that yesterday was the best day of my life
And i owe you for that
Just like i owe michael for europe and the other stuff
And i owe sean for his songs


But so what????


All I want, 
is for one fucking person to value me
And actually want to keep me alive
Instead of putting in 
The tiniest amount of effort
To earn the right 
To say
“But I loved her!
I tried to save her!
For one day!
As it suited me!”


What the fuck were you doing all day that was more important than me?


I would rather you run me over on the street 
Than leave me alone in your bed
Ignoring me
And letting some 
False idea 
Of how i inflated your confidence and value
(FALSE!!!!)
Give you peace
While you sit there
And jack off 
To your math and music and cock
While i die obviously
Wishing just someone 
Would care enough
To knock on the door.


To bring me some foamed milk
After i fucked him so hard.


After I signed two months of my life away
As long as he would
Just fucking
Make me 
Feel valued
And worthy
Of staying alive.


WHY CANT YOU DO THAT JOHN????

Am i not enough for you?
Or am I asking too much?


If you don’t want the kind of assurances that
Fucked-up ladies give you
Then tell me i’m not fucked up
And that you would want me anyway.


I can tell you every fucking way you let me down 
In the last 24 hours
But then i won’t respect you.
CAN’T YOU SEE???


Do you not understand words???
Ideas?
Feelings?

Why are you accepting defeat so easily?
Why are you showing me that I’m really not worth your time
Or effort
Or that you don’t know what to do to make me happy??


I understand that you were tired!!!
I get tired a lot too.
But I TOLD YOU that I was in a bad place.
I TOLD YOU THAT I NEEDED YOU TO SAVE ME
And isn’t that enough to keep you awake?
No, it’s not.


I’m up alone in the night
Trying to convince myself that I’m worth saving


And I did all that research
To show you that 
There isn’t anything wrong with you 
If you want to be rough and dominant


And I did all that research
To show you that
I’m at risk
That i’m at really high risk
Of dying.


And I’m begging you, John!
I’m begging you to save me.
I’m begging you to give me some reason to live
Whether it’s because 
Your cock needs my service so much
Or because you love me
But i guess neither is working.


I don’t understand!!!!

I see that I’m in a bad place.
And that it’s unfair for me to ask you to save me.
But I offered so much!!!!


I thought this contract 
Just really meant
That you would save me.


That somehow I could offer you at least enough
That you would put in the effort
To keep me alive.


But I can see it didn’t work.
And the only reason I’m still alive now
Is because of some strength
Of my own.


I wanted to think that you were worth my life.
I wanted to think that if I died
I would do you some good
Or you would care
Or maybe you would decide
That i had enough to offer you
That it would be worth the smallest efforts on your part
To keep me alive


But clearly not.


You thought one day of me being happy as your sub
Would make me be happy?
That after that I’d just entertain myself
While you entertained yourself?

What were you doing all day???
What were doing all day that was more important 
Than giving me water
Or milk
Or sex
Or love
Or ANYTHING???


I’m not satisfied being in the background.
If that’s what a sex slave is
I’m not into it.


Why did you let me so alone in the locked bathroom for so long for???


Did you see how much I cut my calf??
I’m CRYING OUT FOR HELP.
I’m not even trying to hide it!!!
I TOLD YOU
That i did that because you weren’t 
Giving me enough to think about
Or enough to do.


And your response was to go to sleep??
Leave me alone all night?
And then not even pay attention to me
When you were finally awake????


And then when I still had so much hope
And I’d thought so many nice things about you
You just did your regular day?
And you never needed me?
You never wanted me?
You never thought about me?
You never worried about me?

You thought ONE DAY of me being your sub
Would turn me into your normal girlfriend?

IF that’s what you wanted
You ought not to have told me
That you didn’t want that.


Maybe you’re more fucked up than I am.
I told you what I wanted.
I told you how you could make me happy/survive.


You said that would make you happy too.
And now you’re happy
As you exactly fail to do what i asked 
That you said you would do?


All I want is to be important
And i’ve seen today
That i’m not.


You don’t need me
You just need some idea
Of having someone 
That you never even 
Utilize. 


Why don’t you kill me
And put me out of my misery
And use your ability
To ignore reality
And pretend 
I’m still in your room
Doing whatever useful thing
You thought i was doing 
In here
While you minded your own fucking business.


I wanted you to save me
Because i couldn’t convince myself 
I was worth saving.


Maybe seeing that you don’t either
Will make me reconsider
If i want me for myself.


You don’t want me for you
But maybe i’m more valuable than you


And you see that
And you want to let me go


To try again 
To find someone who both
Wants to save me 
And is worthy of it. 


I believed in you so fucking hard.
All you had to do 
Was not give me the time and space
To think about how 
You were letting me down.


But you gave me so much.
And i thought about dying 
But then it made me mad
To realize that you wouldn’t 
Even fucking care.


I still think you had the most potential, John.
I still think you are a great guy.
I just think you should have told me you wanted me
Or made me yours


But you’ve done neither. 


So now I realize I’m on my own
To find meaning in life.


I can’t give meaning to yours
And you won’t give meaning to mine


So I guess I’ll just go home 
And read more books
And sleep more
And watch more shows


And think about how either
Every person is so disappointing
Or how my expectations are impossible to fill


I wanted more meaning from life.
I thought you could give it to me.
I thought we were in such a special time and place.
Why did you leave me so alone???


I thought you valued me! 
I thought you wanted me!
I thought I was proving to you that i could offer you so much.


But you only want it when you want it
For free
And without the price I’m asking.
Which is meaning and weight and value.


I’m going to ask you to take me home now.
I’m safer there than here.


I’m not going to kill myself if there’s no one to care.
I might as well take the rest of my pills
And eat all those ding dongs
And see what happens


I’m sorry that I asked 
Too much of you 
And that you asked
Too little of me


I think I’m having a bad time.
I think I’m in a bad place.
I think it might be bad.
Didn’t I send you the research??
Didn’t you read it??
Didn’t you care????


I’m afraId I’m trying to be intense
Because of the virus
And because of you
But because of my brain
It’s going to go father than i meant it to
And i had hoped that could lead
To so much hot sex 
And some revelations
But instead
I bet too much on this sexy quarantine life with you
And I lost
And now 
There’s nothing.


I guess I have time. 
I think I’ll fix myself a spliff.


I don’t know what you’re doing out there.
Either you’re letting me decide what i really want
Or you’re feeling tortured by the pain you’ve caused me
And how deeply you’ve let me down
Or you just are doing your own thing
And you don’t fucking care.
OR
You are feeling ineffectual
And you don’t know what to do
And you’re BREAKING MY HEART JOHN


I gave you my LAST
MOST DESPERATE
CHANCE
To survive.


I offered to do everything for you,
To love you more than anyone ever had
To value you so much because you valued me


All i wanted was for you to pay attention to me
To give me that massage i earned
Or watch the show with me
Or give me those six hours of attention a day
Either by pleasing you
Or making you mad


But it didn’t matter
Either way, 
Whether I tried so hard to earn it by being good
Or if i tried to force you to give it
By not doing what you asked


Either way, 
I was all alone 
And paid no attention to.


I don’t know what you want
If you’re happy to spend all fucking day
Doing whatever you were doing


While i was unloved
And dehydrated
Und underutilized
And thirsty
And hungry
And unloved
And unnoticed


But i hope it was the most fucking important 
Thing you’ve ever done in your life.


I hope that you believe whatever you were doing all day 
Was worth more to you
Than my love for you
Or my life
In general.


Cause that’s what you wanted 
And that’s what you got.


Maybe you’ve taught me a lot.
Maybe you’ve saved me after all. 


Maybe I don’t need to be some fucking asshole
Male
Loser
Stupid
Sex slave


To find meaning in my life. 


I tried to give you all my meaning.
I wanted to add it to your value.


BUT YOU FUCKING SHOWED ME
AFTER ONE FUCKING DAY
THAT YOU DON’T 
FUCKING 
NEED ME


So go ahead and do it on your own.
Let’s see how far you get. 


Remember when you made
Me feel happy by saying 
That you’d be happy 
If my book were
Successful????

Well
Now my book is going to be about how  
MEN and 
Their fucking bullshit promises of LOVE
Or even, 
Even,
Just the BASIC
JUST THE MOST BASIC
Fucking level
Of taking care
Of another
Fucking 
Living creature.


JOHN.
Did you pay more ATTENTION  to the survival needs 
Of bernard and walrus
Today
Than you did 
To me???
I think you did.


Did you give them any water
Or food
Or affection?
Did you give me any? 


Your answer doesn’t matter. 
I didn’t feel it. 


If you feel bad after i die
You and michael should talk together
About how easy it was
To let me down


I’m not sure which of you failed me more.
I had almost accepted that I couldn't count on michael
But then you
Tried to trick me 
Into thinking
There was a kind of guy
That i could count on


But you couldn’t even fucking keep up the trick for two days.
It’s the most evil trick
The final letdown.


You saw how much michael broke my heart
Did you think that was a chance to show me 
It could get worse??


I don’t know if you’re cruel or stupid
I think it’s the same
Why would you offer to save me
And then let me down?


Why would you make my hopes up again
For one last time
When you know that being disappointed
Has hurt me so much
And that i was trying to offer you 
Any 
Any 
Any
Any
Other kind of hurt besides that??


How did you not understand 
That all i wanted
Was to not 
Be 
Disappointed???


I didn’t even care what i was signing up for
It could have been bad stuff
I just wanted you to do 
What you said you would do,


I just wanted you to do what you said you would do
And for you to be doing it for me
And not just for you


Or even if it were for you
If you were doing it 
On purpose
And not just 
Because you’re 
Not paying attention
Or even bothering 
To think about it.

Week 2


Monday: ?
Tuesday: 
train tracks reward for something or another. Super freaking hot. Hard on john. The approaching train blew its horn just as we were driving away. He was really angry at me bc he didn’t really want to do it in the first place, then I refused to suck his cock, and it just made him mad. That’s when he said, do you really want to know how much trauma i have inside me? I could really hurt you. But lately he hasn’t said anything about that at all, not when we talk about why he likes this. But my lord this was hot. When he counted to five and I didn’t get his dick all the way in in time, and he smacked me to the ground and started kicking me. I don’t think it was the first time--wasn’t that in his kitchen, where the consequence for something was that he was going to make me clean his kitchen floor on my hands and knees, chained, while he kicked the shit out of me. That was definitely his idea. Where did that motivation come from? And the other time when the consequence was to slap me, and he dragged me to the kitchen and was that the first time he slapped me? I don’t know why I love how it felt so much. I can’t remember which of those was the time that I tried so hard to do the puzz in under ten minutes, just barely didn’t make it, and then threw the pad aside in defeat, despair, and fear of what was to come. So fucking hot. 
Wednesday: 
job interview. I started getting cold sores (he whipped me on the face at the tracks) so I took a million pills and got painful diarrhea. I still finished my presentation and got all dressed up, but asked if he could come over here instead. He didn’t like that, and took me to the road and set me down. I was terrified. But at home I melted his anger by telling him I wanted the position because I love him. Then I gave my presentation, I got hired, we wrote our contract, signed it in blood, had great sex, and he fell asleep. I was up all night in the music room writing 
Thursday:
When he woke up in the morning, he came in with the collar and ankle cuffs, put them on me, took me out into the living room and…what? He asked me if I remembered and then reminded me but now i forgot. Once i sucked his dick in his office chair. Once he fucked me from behind while i kneeled in a flimsy lawnchair in the backyard. We also did yoga out there, and at some point i poured boiling water on my left hand while i was making his coffee. I did the dishes, the laundry, vacuumed, and wrote 100 times that he thinks i’m the most beautiful wildflower in the meadow and he’s plucked me to keep all for himself. I also did school work, and almost ran out of time to do my writing and vacuum before 10.  If I hadn’t done it, he was going to whip me 100 times. Yikes. Or spank? Still yikes. But i made it, with three minutes to spare. My hand was almost falling off. When I was done he read it while I kneeled in front of him. Everytime I found a mistake, he’d circle it with his orange pen, walk around and bend down to show me what I’d done wrong, and then spank me. Sometimes he’d spank me first. He said my left-hand try looked like a methhead. He said my ‘in”s looked like arabic. I felt like this had been the best day of my life.
I stayed up all night in the kitchen writing little love cards and love letter to him, and eating the casserole he’d made us for dinner, and swiping the serrated bread knife across the back of my right calf every time I went over for a bite. When I was finally tired I snuck into bed and we had amazing sex. 
Friday:
It all went wrong. 


Once he made me lick the hardwood floor. I love when he pushes my head down into it. 


Last week I complained that all my tabs were slowing my mac down (the way our porn slows down the big mac) and proclaimed from now I was just shutting em all down and starting fresh. He said yeah, it doesn’t matter!


I said but i won’t have my suicide hotline tab
And he said 
I didn’t need it anymore
So sweet


Once he checked on my wound,
Said, “you’re ok”
And I said,
“I know I am” 
With all the weight of grand sincerity
And he was so happy
And we had the sweetest hug
And what a blessing
That it makes us each so happy
To make the other happy
And be appreciated
And have our love be felt


Remember they said grief is just
When you have love to give
And can’t give it? 


Plus we’re learning 
So much 
And so fast.
Our rate of increase 
Has been huge
After the slow burn
Of our start.


We might just want to 
Try a more constant
Increase
So as not to 
Up the ante
So so high
So so fast.


Maybe because we’re 
Each so perfect
And we’ve spent
So much time
Learning 
And 
Liking 
Each other,
We thought it would be easy
To do anything 
Together.


Like when john did
The thizzle pills
And felt his brain
Sizzle a little
(like the plug on my toaster!)
(like the lighter under my neck)
And then he 
Felt himself
Thinking Harder 
To understand the math. 


Then he said, 
Maybe the math just got harder?
It certainly did.
And so have we.
We’re not doing worse
We’re just searching for
Intractable relationship
Solutions 
That others have given up on.


But! We’ll get one of those millennium prizes when we do it!


I’m sorry I tried to quit the project,
The seminar,
The research,
The job,
You, 
Me
And life. 
Monday April 6


Um...it probably wasn’t personal. Which isn’t to say that you didn’t have the power to stop my pain, but you didn’t cause it, and it would have been there either way. Maybe feeling so close to feeling safe made me more afraid that it wasn’t real. I really really hope you believe me that I wasn’t trying to manipulate you or hold you hostage. I was just asking for help, trying to express that I really really needed you, at a time when I didn’t think any of my other coping mechanisms or means of communication were enough. And that’s not just because you didn’t wake me up, it’s also because of everyone I ever knew and their reaction to the virus. I’ve told you before you’re my last chance, and I don’t mean that as a threat either. I just feel like I’ve tried so hard before, and I’m planning to try my hardest ever with you. So it’s just that if that doesn’t work, I can’t imagine having any hope yet. I am putting all my eggs in your basket, and I”m betting the farm, and I’m trading in all my stocks for blow jobs, and I’m believing as hard as I fucking can (I’m happy that today I can) that if it is possible for one person to meet all of another person’s needs, that I am going to do that for you. Don't get your boner all stressed out--I hope to be strong, confident, with a sense of self-purpose (and well-loved enough--that’s your job) to graciously participate in an open relationship that allows us both to be reminded how amazing the other is. I don’t want to be polyamorous, though. I never used that word with Michael, never thought it was okay, until I met you. Then I thought, okay, polyamory is chill. But now I change my mind. I know no one can stop either of us from falling in love with someone else, but you see that it takes a long time. If Michael had been loving me enough, if he had been here for me, I wouldn’t have had the time or energy to devote so much thought and love to you. So I think sex and dating are fine, but not falling in love? Is that okay to ask, of either of us? Remember one night I heard a song lyric that said “this will be the last time I fall in love,” and it was supposed to be romantic, but I thought it was sad? Now I’m not sure. It’s still sort of sad, but not sad like a dog finding its forever home, or sad like having your dream career. Maybe I assumed that if you didn’t fall in love again, that was the end of love and excitement for you. But maybe the real alternative is just staying in love and being excited by that and each other? I mean, just reeling someone in enough to bang them is pretty exciting. Falling in love is a different kind. Certainly rarer and more work to find. I don’t know.


My gosh, look at me now! 
For weeks I’ve been feeling tremendous relief that life as we knew it might be over.
And for days I’ve felt that wasn’t going to be enough for me.
If it DID go back to normal,
I don’t think I could take it. 
You can’t go back
You can’t unknow
You can certainly uncare though!
How bout that.


All I wanted was to not think about the future, not have to figure out all that stuff that I keep trying to figure out.


But now he’s talking about if we need to take down the ropes when Josey comes over,
And I’m talking about if he can move to a research university
Assuming i’ll be with him.


It’s almost dirty and perverse in the same taboo way
As the bdsm sex is
To indulge so much 
In this mushy sincere love
With tenderness and tears
And sweet scary statements 
Of overcommitment 


All the things we think 
We aren’t supposed to and
Shouldn’t do
Are the most exciting 
To do 
When you decide to do them anyway.


He seemed a little less sure than me.
I’m still confused about what he wants
Even though i asked and he told me.
I guess i asked if he would 
Have wanted me as a regular girlfriend
And not
DO you want me as a regular girlfriend?
Should I ask that?
Am I pushing too much?
Does he love it
Or does it freak him out?
Does it freak him out 
Because I’m made him
So scared of being sweet
That he thinks it might be a trap
To trick him into being so sweet
That I don’t like him anymore??


Okay, so he says no, he doesn’t think it’s a trap
And i’ve convinced him about the radical candor
And he takes me at my word
That’s so relaxing.


Also he knows he can always read my things
If he ever doubts my sincerity 
Or level of disclosure
With the caveat
That if he reads anything concerning
(or extra sweet)
He has to talk to me about it


Or have the tables really turned 
To where he’s worried instead
Of I’m worried?


Okay, so he says no, 
That he loves it when I say sweet things
And that i don’t need to worry
About being tooo sweet
Or cloying


________________


Sat Apr 4 - Mon Apr 6


(Three highlights: slapping my clamped nipple with the mac case, smothering me with the towel [nb, smothering seems less fun than choking], and what he said to me after he tied me up)


What a date! 
Sometimes I think this quarantine is all one big date.
We realized we don’t need to worry so much
About pushing through,
Because there are lots more to come
Or at least a few.


I guess that’s one of the things the virus has taught me
You can’t count on things staying the same
Any day, everything could change.


I’m pretty sure Rainer’s been telling me that all along
And i did believe him
And I haven’t taken 
the parts of my life i enjoyed
For granted.


Today we did the crossword challenge again
I got it in 9:28.
Under five was that he’d gently shave my pussy
5-10 was that i’d wear the tail and crawl around,
And 10-15 was that I’d spend 24 hours being his barmaid,
Wearing an apron and bringing him drinks
And he might not always be the nicest customer
Sometimes he might be the difficult kind
Who slaps me on the ass on my way out
Or says the drink tastes like piss
And to make it again
Or maybe even throw it in my face.
He does have a loooottttt of good ideas.


I mean, if he’s not really into the bdsm
He is still sure talented at it
He has quite a knack.


Tonight when I smashing my face into his jeans
I looked up and said
I know what you want.
He asked what
And I said,
You want me to beg for your cock.


I said, 
Please, may I unbuckle your belt
Pretty please may I unzip your pants
Pretty please with a cherry on top 
May I take your cock out?
What will you do with it then,
He asked?
I’ll eat it all up! 
I said.
It’s my sundae with cherry on top.


He looked at me a minute,
And said
“Okay, Sophy.
You can have my cock.
But you have to get it out.
With your hands on my feet
Using just your teeth.”


Damn!
Good fucking plan!
Make me work for it!
And give me a chance to show off my fucking skills.
I asked if I could use my tongue as well,
He permitted it, 
And then I proceeded to
Pull his belt loose, 
Through several smooth maneuvers
Of my teeth and tongue and head
And i used my tongue
To lick and flip the male part of the buckle
To the right 
So I could pull the rest of the belt free.


I confessed I was worried about the button
That’s always the hardest part for my hands
But i gripped hard and pulled to the right 
And it came right out.
Maybe i should do it like that
All the time


It was also easy
To grab the zipper pull
With my teeth.
At first I tried to pull too 
Fast and hard
And lost my grip.
But i quickly realized that the key was to 
Go slow and steady
And let the teeth fall apart
Instead of ripping them 
Out of alignment


(Did he like when he was whipping my face with the large whip, and when he paused and slowly pulled it across my face, or who knows, maybe he was mashing it into my face and mouth, and I grabbed onto it with my teeth when he tried to pull it away, and he had to pull harder and shake my head around with it to make me let loose. Is that something that is intense but not frustrating? 


We had a fight about how he’d know if I was giving him 70% of my sucking strength. 
Finally he pushed me away.
So sad.
He was frustrated.
I just wanted him to push my head onto his cock just how he wanted
But i guess i had already been doing it just how he wanted
And he wanted to enjoy it
Instead of me keep interrupting to encourage him
To push my head down.
In retrospect,
I WAS giving him pretty exceptional head.
I wanted to give him control,
But it wasn’t the right time.


I guess he should have told me to shut the fuck up and keep sucking
Or pushed my head down when i tried to get up and talk.
I’m encouraging him to influence my behavior
During primary protocol,
So it can be sexy and instructive
Instead of making me
Pouty, resentful, and hurt.


I WANT him to tell me what to do and how to act. 
I don’t understand why,
If he doesn’t like me defying him,
He doesn’t just nip it in the bud
When i first start up.
If he wants me to be submissive because he wants to dominate me
Then he should dominate me 
And make me do it. 
But if he wants me to be submissive because he wants 
Non-coerced-looking-sex,
Then he should just say,
“I don’t want to be rough right now
I love what you’re doing 
And i just want to keep
Enjoying you do it” 


I’d understand that.
But it’s no good for me to keep
Goading him into giving me something
That he doesn’t want to give.


Then we’re both unhappy. 
We said we were taking a day off
But then he put in the tail
And i took off my glasses
And i thought we were moving
Into high protocol.


I guess next time i’ll just try asking.
It’s just that i did ask a couple of times
And it was distracting me
And i thought him.
Getting him to do it in the
Context of the sex scenario
Seemed less distracting. 


________________


I think we’re all like Billy Pilgrim.
Getting unstuck in time
Traveling around from life to life.


That’s really how I felt when I came back to after John slapped me in the chair in his living room.
Wow, I had forgotten what instigated my use of Heideger!
Ridiculous, because that was huge.
I don’t know if he slapped me harder,
Or if i was weakened.
I think he slapped me four times?
Or only once?


It felt almost like coming out of the DMT
Like I’d been somewhere else
Like I’d been somewhen else
And I had to think a minute
To remember where I was supposed to be
And what the context was
And how I was supposed to feel.


And I saw john’s face close up in mine
It was all i could see
And also the feelings of my body
Were started to buzz
And fuzz back in 


And he had that wild look on his face
Which normally i love 
In times like that
But it’s not his normal face
And i was trying to 
Understand what reality i was in
And that face
Comes in a reality
That is not quite ours
And it wasn’t what i wanted to come back to


But i remembered enough
I used my safe word
And i knew i just wanted
To lie with him
And be in that reality for a while.


I know this is the feeling of passing out, either from choking or standing up too fast, and it was the feeling of the dmt (though that was more intense)...is this just what coming out of unconsciousness always feels like? Why Rainer had his epiphany after anesthesia? Why people love auto-erotic asphyxiation? I thought it just made the orgasm more intense. I didn’t think it was about traveling to different realities or reaching into your consciousness. 


He wanted me to tell him to “shut the fuck up and focus on tying me up” because he kept getting distracted having fun talking to me. 


I popped off my mouth gag, after one half of the mac case broke into pieces after the first hit, and spouted, “Made in China!!!” and then sucked the gag back in and looked at him with really big excited eyes. It was a risk, because I wasn’t supposed to talk, and he could have reacted madly, but instead he appreciated my joke and later said he was glad I did it. Even the contract encourages me to use my intuition and do things that I think will please him. 


We talked about ways to limit my talking, but they were either too complicated, or carried too high a risk that we’d miss a brilliant idea. Plus we like talking to each other. It’s such a sweet sweet combination of hard and soft. I would say hot and cold, but it’s really hot and hot. I’m glad I’m not in a situation like Doug has. That would make me feel bad. Does that girl feel bad? Did she already feel bad and this helps her be a little better?


That night (well, at 1pm), we cuddled in bed while i tried to find a way to rest my neck and not let my sweat drip all over john. My scalded hand was stinging and I wanted to put something on it. 


I think it’s important that he look at my wounds after a session and make sure nothing needs attending to. I can’t blame him for not caring for wounds that I inflict myself, but ones he gives me, he should take nursing responsibility for. Like the cigarette burn. Shouldn’t he have been putting some neosporin on that? I thought maybe my scald was second degree, so i looked up the distinctions (it’s just whether it goes through 1, 2, or 3 layers of your skin), and it turns out the scald is first degree, but the cigarette burn is second. (We talked about it and he agreed, so he came on my scald (seemed to help!) and put neosporin on my cig burn. He also agreed to keep my right arm unmarred. 


I was a little sad last night thinking about how pretty and nice my skin used to be. I should tell him I want to keep my right arm nice. 


He said, “I thought you wanted to be hurt. I’m confused about what you want.” I told him I totally understood, but there was the line between stimulating exciting pain, and totally painful overwhelming pain. Obviously as the giver it is harder for him to know what is too much, but I think he probably is responsive to when I tense all up for a few seconds, and then relax a bit and start breathing again. That probably means that I’m ready for more, but hopefully not the exact same thing. And the more seconds I’m looking away and moaning in pain, the less likely I want you to do it again. I like things that are intense, but that I can bounce back from quickly, painwise. I did also want to talk about how I react after something like that. It was hurting quite a lot when you whipped the inside of my thigh, and after I’d hide it away and cringe for a bit, I’d open my thighs up to you again. I’m not sure if you interpret that as submission or defiance. I mean it to be the former. What I’m saying by doing that, by facing you again and not turning I’m saying that I’m not hiding from you, that I’m opening up my still-stinging vulnerable thighs to you, showing that I trust you. I’m hoping that you won’t do the exact same thing in the exact same place right away, but I want you to know that I’m leaving that decision up to you, and I’m brave enough for whatever you decide to do. You could also interpret it as a challenge, depending how close to the edge you want to push me at the time. You could keep going until I protect that part for long enough to show you I’ve had enough and enter position two, if I can, to show you that you’ve reached that limit of my bravery. It just depends on if you are trying to give me that exciting amount of pain that turns us on, or if you’re in that mood where you want to demonstrate your dominance. I still don’t understand how to get you there without making you angry. I know I’ve asked more than once, but I still don’t have a handle on it. Maybe you don’t either. Honestly, that would be okay with me. Like I said, I recently wanted that extreme amount of pain and dominance (well, last week) because I was trying to suppress my internal pain which was particularly intolerable, by trading in my fears for physical pain and trust in you. I suggested to you once that I might not want to do that anymore if you taught me yoga and loved me, but you said you didn’t think that would happen. I agree I wanted extreme sex even before this happened, but it was more in the form of shared intensity, and not so much about me receiving pain from you. I wasn’t then (as far I knew/know) trying to shove down any bad feelings. I was just super energized by fucking you and wanted to do it as hard as I could, and try all the different things because they’re so fun. I guess you’re right--maybe it was when you fucked my throat so hard that I realized I liked showing how much I could do and far I would go for you. And I kept liking it and liking it. Yeah, slippery slope. Haha, we’re not at all like the frog in the boiling water, because the point is that he’s dead before he even realizes the water’s heating up. But we know. We see. What kind of curve do you think we’re on? Is it like the virus? Are we almost at the apex, or are we at the linear appearing part before things really get going? I loved it when he said, “Now we’re getting somewhere.” Doesn’t that imply he wants to keep going there? I’m so confused. Maybe I should just tone it down and be less demanding and do what he tells me to do during sex for a couple days. He’s got such good ideas, though. Maybe he’ll come up with some way to please us both. I just hate thinking that i’m the only one who likes this and that he’s doing it for me despite his own preferences.  But I think I’ve given him plenty of opportunities to tell me “I don’t want to do this anymore. Let’s just be lovers who have really hot sex.” He hasn’t taken any of them. But he was also embarrassed to admit that he’d have loved me regardless, so maybe he’d be embarrassed to

Amus
I've been going through my old hard drives. I haven't heard this song in ten years, and I forgot how it ends. Hearing it again ripped my heart apart
  

  

0:03 / 4:34
  

  

I my god Opotamus !!!
I honestly haven’t recollected this song is so long. Now I’m crying   
Can I ask you a last favor amus? I'll forgive everything I ever fairly or unfairly blamed you for if you do this
I don't have any of your songs after 2010. I don't have a recorded version of that song, or what "you know" became
And I was supposed to be the guardian of all your songs
I need them, Doll
  

Even if you blamed me for everything ever, I would still do that for you.
  

1
I will start chipping away at this project. You are indeed the guardians of all my songs !
Madison and I have been stuck at home for quite a few weeks now, so that seems like a good opportunity !
I hope you are well and safe   
Thank you amus. That will mean the world to me. I'm glad you and Madison are safe. Stuck at home is The Place to be!

I know. I can’t believe all the assholes and imbeciles still out and about
Mar 25, 2020, 11:40 PM
I never understood your deep existential pain and disgust with humanity until now
But now I understand
We all deserve to die
I feel like I'm living in a completely different world than other people!!
Like a twilight zone or a nightmare
  

It really does hurt.
I'm sorry I didn't understand you before
I don't know how you've lived with it all these years
  

It hurts how many people actually don’t give a shit. It hurts how many opportunities I missed to make a difference because I was too busy hurting

I was in my ladida Polly pockets ladida spliffs bubble

I just want the balance of my days spent making the world a bit happier and better place.
Your songs are such a treasure amus
You added so much beauty to this world
I wish more people appreciated you
  

You were just doing what we all were doing... trying the best we can with what little we were given in a world that mostly values money and power. Be easy on yourself.
I was scared of everything for years; a freer in the headlights. I am slowly coming into the light.
*deer*
Tee hee yeah
  

I have many new songs. I’ll sing them for you when we are free to congregate again
I thought I had finally gotten all self actualized this year... And then everything I thought I knew was meaningless
But can't you zoom me a concert or something?
  

Yes !! Zoom concert !!! All the kids are doing it !
I love trees and songs
You promised me a lifetime of concerts amus
  

I did. I will keep that promise
I missed a lot of them
I never heard some
That's so wrong
  

It’s okay. I missed some too. I’ve not had much music in my life the last few years.
Perhaps you are the catalyst of my return
I hope so. I've been a failed muse save for you.  But your songs are worth it. I have to go, doll, this is making me too sad. But can we talk sometime? I want to make amends
  

I too would love to make amends. A part of my heart and creative spirit will forever be yours.
Sweet dreams until we talk
Okay. Sweet dreams and "Omar!"
  

Nate is a giraffe
I love Nate

Mar 27, 2020, 11:02 PM
amus, i'm here to report that i'm ready for my zoom concert at any point. i got trained on zoom
  

I see a Zoom concert in the not-too-distant future
please don't disappoint me
i need it soon
Mar 30, 2020, 8:28 AM
  

Madison had another episode this weekend.
The neighbors called the police after she was yelling that she wanted to kill herself. I’ll let you know when my fucked up life is less fucked up
Mar 30, 2020, 11:38 AM
I'm sorry, although I can understand her point. What do you mean by episode? Is she suffering from a mental illness? You of all people should understand someone wanting to escape the pain of life
If she wants to talk to me I'd be happy to
  

I understand all too well her suffering.
The last couple of years have been a roller coaster ride. I suspect borderline personality disorder, though with a young adult it can be hard to get at the root of things. Today has been nice and calm.
Thank you for offering to talk with her. I will let her know.
Tue 1:26 PM
madison is a treasure

10:10 AM
  

It will be very hard to get my head above water this week, but do you want me to do a Zoom Opotamus concert on either Monday or Tuesday evening (13th or 14th) ?
11:39 AM
I would absolutely love it, doll
  

Okay !!! Do you have a preference for on of those evenings ??
2:34 PM
I choose Monday because there's a higher chance we'll both still be alive
Can I make requests?
  

Haha !!! That is a statistical truth !
Yes, request away !
 Seen by Sean Harrasser at 2:50 PM

Great! Basically I want every song that's about an amus, except PU b/c that's too sadly full of hope. But ones like, fourteen, sunlight, rain, fifty years, and any new ones I never heard, even if they make me cry. I remember there was one that mentioned slc that I only heard once. And any new ones that are power ballads like forever approaching zero cause those are my fave. also it's been a long day, cause it has. maybe wander? And definitely I'm not Afraid, because that's acutely relevant. Oh, and the piano song with the chorus "You Know." I dont know if that was ever recorded or got a different name, but you played it a lot at my new house and i loved hearing it.
i hope judy and egon are okay


A lot of my pain about either Michael, the virus, or all my life changes have been surfacing as grief about Sean. Maybe the Michael pain is too fresh, but I know I need to grieve something? Or maybe I realize that Sean loved me more. Michael denies it, but how does he know? I told Kit I’ve already been grieving Michael for a long time. I don’t know if it’s true. Maybe I was just expecting it, or fearing it. I want to say I really thought things might change when he finished. He’d eventually find a position somewhere goth, and he’d be old enough to have realized that he’d never find someone better for him than his gma, and we’d live happily ever after, never taking it for granted because we’d spent so many years longing for each other.  


I wonder if Michael is doing some tragic soap opera thing where he loves me and wants me, but doesn’t think he’s good enough for me (either period or without finishing his phd), and is forcing me into John’s arms as a sacrifice? That doesn’t seem like Michael. He told me he’s afraid he’s boring. But I’ve never complained about that, except when I complain that he does things with other people that he won’t do with me. If he’s worried I think he’s boring, he could at least try the things with me that he does with them. Or all the times we’d walk by something cool looking in Europe, and I’d pull on his arm and say, “That looks cool. You wanna check it out?”  He either wouldn’t answer me, or would say, “Maybe later.” 


Oh my god two of my mom’s uncles and her grandfather killed themself 30s, 40s, 
One of them had jaw cancer when he was 30
Her one sister is bipolar and the other had shock treatments bc of post-partum depression


How really is this different from domestic violence?
If someone saw my bruises 
And saw me flinch when john moves near me,
They might ask if he was hitting me.
If I said no, or that it was consensual,
They might ask further about our relationship
Hear that i think you’re all i have
Don’t the abused women often say,
“But he loves me!”
“He takes care of me!”
“I need him!”
But the difference is that they are afraid.
They don’t think it’s sexy.
They want it to stop happening.


That’s a huge difference, right???
I’m not sure I’ve ever really known any abused women
Except on tv.
They all seem desperate and stressed out and trapped.
But I’m happy and relaxed and tied up.
I’m just thinking that to an outsider
It would be hard to tell the difference.


And if anyone noticed, and worried,
Wouldn’t that be us involving
Innocent bystanders in our sex life,
Whether they want to be or not?
That’s not allowed.


I don’t want to have to cover my bruises.
Remember that time after Goat whipped me
Too hard and unsatisfyingly
In...2010? 
I roller skated around town 
In cut-off jean shorts
And taught at butte
With my short dresses.


Was I crazy that year too? 
My lord. 
But those students have lived some life
Some of those women had been abused.
I hope they didn’t worry
But felt solidarity
And understanding.


I suppose we could limit marks to my torso and ass during summer? 
I did offer to cover up for him at work
Which is a HUGE offer
Because he knows how much gratification I get from my outfits
And how much i love sundresses
But i don’t think he had a minute to appreciate it
Because he had been worried about telling me
About enrollment drops
And hence lecturer cuts
Next semester.


But I don’t care anymore.
I don’t need a job.
Because now I have him.
I told him that,
Prefaced by “real talk,”
But he just said,
He knew that. 


Plus, he is my job.
I offered myself to him full time.
And I can focus on my book.
That didn’t really match with teaching anyway.
It is weird to think that I might not
Ever teach math at Chico state again.
I really enjoyed it,
And each group of kids made it different,
And teaching new courses was fun,
But i think it was getting a little stale.


Remember how excited I was to give it up and move to Italy?
The only reason I cooled my heels 
Was because of Lumi and John and 
Coke and the master’s classes
And my great teaching schedule
And a renewed appreciation 
Of my house and things
As i thought about leaving them.


My mom says that if her John dies before she does, I’ll get the house. I told that to John, except I said, “we’ll get the house.” I couldn’t tell if he had a reaction or not. It was a sweet but bold move, but also potentially freaky.


He said he’s long past being worried about us getting too serious.
But he does still say he likes to be alone.
He said he had a moment of superficial questioning 
If he really wanted to sign this contract
And throw his chips in with mine 
The night i freaked out the most this week
(Friday after the Thursday that I called the best day of my life,
Which was after the Wednesday night that was my most terrifying experience,
Which was after the Tuesday night that was the most intense 
Sexual experience of my life (train tracks). 
Can’t remember what happened Monday.


I told him he could move anything he wanted 
That I had placed on his office desk
As set dressing.
I pointed out there are times I don’t want things moved.
He asked, for example what in here?
I answered that I would be sad if he moved my little girl picture
From its perch above his desk
For when he gets the math blues
And put it in the closet.
He said “you know what,
That’s my favorite thing in here.”
So so so sweet.


I finally asked him if he would still be with me
And still want to be boyfriend/girlfriend
If I weren’t offering this ultra-ultra
Exciting sex.
He did think about it a minute,
But determined that yes, 
He would still be happy to be with me
In a more traditional sense.
I pressed a little. 
I said, so I would have been able to overcome
Your resistance to being in a relationship
Even without the kinky sex and the virus.
He said yes,
And then,
That he was a little embarrassed about it!!
But I LOVE it when he says sweet
Tender
Loving 
Things to me.


I guess I did tell him not to be too mushy
And he did tell me he’s been restraining
His puppy dog tendencies
So that makes me feel 
Like it’s extra sweet of me
To ask
And basically give him the go ahead
To turn on the mushy feelings and sentiments.


But then I’m also starting to feel a little toooo mushy myself
Not in the sense that i don’t like it
But in that it’s going to be too much for him
And he’ll start to feel trapped
And like i’m not as cool as he thought
Because i’ve clung to him 
So quickly
Cleaved to him
So completely.


I hope he doesn’t think it was all a plan
That i was “playing” hard to get the whole time.
I told him the truth, 
As i always do,
That while I was trying make dating/chasing me
Titillating and exciting
I also just 
AM 
Hard to get.
I really didn’t want to be gotten
But he’s just toooooo good
And i guess i realized,
Esp after the virus
That i myself ought to get
While the gettin’s good. 


But remember when I complained 
That he’d made me need him,
And that he’d done it on purpose?
He said plainly
That he did
Do it on purpose.
Was that just a sexy thing to say? 


MAIN THEMES: Does reality exist as I perceive it? Obviously not, so why would that be my main theme? To what extent does it influence my perception?

Help, I Think I'm In Love With Andrew Cuomo??
 Rebecca Fishbein
3/19/20 12:20PM•
Filed to:ANDREW CUOMO


My roommates moved out of my Brooklyn apartment just ahead of the pandemic, and their replacements haven’t moved in yet. (At this point, they might not move in at all.) This means I haven’t had much company in the last week, and based on current covid-19 predictions, it might be like this for a long time. I am lonely and scared and anxious, but I have mitigated some of these feelings with my day’s two bright spots: 1) My afternoon run, and 2) New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s daily streamed press conference.
I worked in local New York news for years and developed an intense and reasonable dislike of Cuomo. He has repeatedly hindered attempts to reform the criminal justice system, he took advantage of a once largely conservative state Congress to keep progressive legislation on reproductive health from becoming law, he fucked around with the MTA so much he forced out the only useful subway leader the administration’s ever seen, etc., etc., etc.
And yet, in this time of crisis, with little concrete information available, I need Cuomo’s measured bullying, his love of circumventing the federal government, his sparring with increasingly incompetent city leadership. Not only that, but the less contact I have with other humans, the more I start to think of Cuomo as my only friend. I’ve started laughing at his little jokes. I catch myself touching my hair (not my face!) when he talks about an increase in testing capacity. I swooned when he told a reporter he had his own workout routine. I have watched a clip of him and brother Chris Cuomo bickering about their mother at least 20 times. I think I have a crush???
It seems I’ve fallen victim to Stockholm Syndrome, which Merriam-Webster defines as “the psychological tendency of a hostage to bond with, identify with, or sympathize with his or her captor.” Cuomo isn’t holding me hostage so much as coronavirus is, but he is the only one telling me what to do, where I can and cannot go (anywhere), who I can and cannot see (everyone), who I can and cannot listen to (President Trump, Bill de Blasio), what I can and cannot eat (anything but pasta).
Each day, he reinforces those rules, and though at first I chafed at isolation, now I know it’s good for me. I’m being kept safe! He really cares! I have completely forgotten about his refusal to legalize marijuana or enact bail reform! I’m sure he’s doing this all for my own good, and for yours too! Should I not have voted for Cynthia Nixon???
And now, when I stream his presser on the governor’s website—every day around 11:30 a.m., complete with a PowerPoint presentation—I feel comforted. I feel alive. I feel protected. I feel... butterflies.
I text my friend Dave, a local reporter and someone I probably won’t see in person for months. “I think I love Andrew Cuomo?” I write.
“You have a deep sickness,” he responds.
It’s not just me. Suddenly, everyone loves Andrew Cuomo. Ben Smith, the New York Times’s new media columnist, wrote a column this week headlined “Andrew Cuomo is the Control Freak We All Need Right Now.” Politico ran a profile on him that digs into his past (and present?) presidential aspirations. Reporters I trust and respect keep talking about how this is Cuomo’s “finest moment.” There is also some intense discussion online over whether or not Cuomo is hot. I say yes. Sandra Lee, please let me have him.
You may think my brain is poisoned. You are probably correct. We are only about one week into New York’s tangible coronavirus crisis. No one knows how long this will last, how many people it will kill, how many jobs will ultimately be lost, or what the city will look like when we emerge.
As I sit alone in my apartment on the couch one of my roommates left behind, wondering when I can escape, if I’m already sick, if anyone will ever hug me again, if my 74-year-old father will survive this, only one thing is certain. Andrew Cuomo, Dear Leader, will take care of me. He loves me. He is the only one who is here for me. He will help me get through this.
And when I finally do, I will need an endless amount of anti-brainwash therapy so I can rightfully yell at him for using prison labor to make hand sanitizer.
Okay!! So John isn’t my Jesus, he’s my Cuomo. Or Cuomo is Jesus. No they both are!


I asked him to do me a favor while I washed the dinner dishes (I made the salad and reheated the casserole he made, totally made the whole dinner myself), and he said, ‘Take out the trash?” I said, “No! But that’s a sweet offer. I was going to ask if you would play piano while I do the dishes.” And he did and i loved it and I hope he did too. 


During the organization’s coronavirus briefing on Monday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “appalled” by the comments from the scientists at a time when there was need for global “solidarity” to defeat the march of the pandemic. The comments, made during a discussion on French television last week, were centered on the launch of trials in Europe and Australia to see if a tuberculosis vaccine could be used to treat the virus.
“If I can be provocative, shouldn’t we be doing this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatments, no intensive care?” Jean-Paul Mira, head of intensive care at Cochin hospital in Paris, said. “A bit like as it is done elsewhere for some studies on Aids. In prostitutes, we try things because we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves.”
Camille Locht, research director at France’s national health institute, Inserm, agreed, saying: “You are right. We are in the process of thinking about a study in parallel in Africa.”
Tuesday night
 
I know because nick was there on his riding lawnmower with his muscles. 
But i don’t need to make john jealous of nick.
John has his own muscles
And i’m his riding mower
And i don’t even want to make him jealous
Because he makes me feel
Like he already 
Appreciates what he has.


Every perverse thing we suggest turns out to be hot
In retrospect at least.
I wore trashy knee-high skin-tone nylons 
For my Linda, Alison, forever-waitress
Only job for a woman
Escaping a small town
Abusive husband
Small child
No education
Unsupportive parents.


He wanted to shove them down my throat to choke me
But they didn’t obstruct my nose
He gave up
And i grabbed one and pulled it over my head
Like a robber
Or a mannequin


He cut a slit for my mouth
I thought those robbers could see
But i guess not.
At least they could breathe!

John was so turned on.
Way more than he expected.
He put his hand over my mouth
And told me to shut up.
I was glad.
I realized i’m just making all those sounds
So he doesn’t think 
I’m one of those dreaded common girls 
Who
“Just lies there”
(which seems to turn him on quite a bit when I do it, by the way)
And honestly would rather not
Deal with it
If it doesn’t come up on its own.


But why did he shooosh me? 
Did he want to forget I was me?
Did the nylon mask 
Obscuring my face
Make him feel like he was fucking 
Something bigger than me?
No, 
Just something less specific?
Fucking his dick into the world
Without any thought 
To anything but 
His own dick
And his own fucking.


That’s absolutely fucking fine with me.
We love each other.
I know that now.
We don’t need to gaze into each other’s eyes
Every tiem we fuck
Just to prove it.


He wanted me helpless and impaired
And compromised 
And all smooshed up.
And NOT about anonymizing


I want to feel like the whole world is fucking me
Not just one guy
Not even the best guy
I just want to feel 
Like i’m getting fucked.
In general and overall and without my participation required.

I think we’re both on the same page.
We want the best there is to offer,
Meat wise
Plus more. 
All the more.


I wonder if the guys really mean it 
When they say the worst possible partner
Is the girl who just lies there.
Maybe that’s what they really want.
Clean my floor and lie there while i fuck you
Don’t get all turned on
Don’t squeeze out my cock
With your pussy contractions. 


We collaborated on picking out my waitress outfit
Our ideas really elevate each other. 
I got the lime green kitten pumps
To match my yellow apron.


I sewed bells to my collar
(but not to my skin,
Though he might have liked that,
But maybe not…
The lines are so confusing.
We just keep pushing and pushing 
The line in between us 


Back and forth and 
Directions we don’t know about
Until we find
Where it either naturally lay
Or where we fucking hammer it down.)


Because we have control.
Isn’t that his whole point?
That he wants to be in control?
And of course he knows that is futile.
(he says that makes sense,
But acknowledges that it is futile
And doesn’t even really want 
Control over me,
It’s the sexual power 
That’s overwhelming
Intoxicating
intense.)


Is the virus-related loss of control
Making him want to find new ways of taking control
Like over me?
Yes.
But he always wanted it.


Did he try to take control of the other girls?
Yes….but they gave it up easier.
And offered a lot less.
He’s always wanted to feel in control
But hasn’t always had it. 


I needed to be out of his control
He wasn’t seeking control of me
I wasn’t seeking to be controlled
Except in bed.
But then i lost all the control 
Bc of the virus
And michael
And needed to cash in.


But we encountered extraordinary circumstances
That brought out these underlying needs
That we had so so luckily
Laid the groundwork
To satisfy each other. 


Does it make him sensitive 
When i joke about lurie
Or scholtze ?
I’m just trying to tell him
That he’s
Exactly my type? 




________________


Late Tuesday night
After john fucked me so good
With a nylon stocking over my face
And my tongue flicking the tip of his dick
Just like he told me to,
And i made him cum so hard on
My nylon face, my pushed-up boobs
And my scalded hand
(Do you see that that’s two times?
In one night?
One hot
And one medicinal?)


And now I’m up alone in the night
In the living room of his house
Our south chico house.
We forgot to bring a lamp
But i guess he has a spare.
I plugged it in
But it’s the kind that glares.
I guess they all are.


I wish I could get some fucking light in here!
Okay…
I wish it didn’t fucking glare!


We’re both so aware of our contradictions
We both realize we’re asking the other for 
Two impossible things.
I’m asking:
Fuck me like you think I’m the sexiest woman ever
Love me like I’m the most valuable creature that ever existed
Punish me like i have so much more potential
Control me as if you know best 
how to make me count.
Show me how my inherent value 
Can be of value
To you
And then to me.
Show me through the intensity of your passion 
And your lovemaking
And your gestures
And your desire
That i’m the only one
Who has ever
Showed a glimmer
Of living up to 
Your high expectations.


Because you’re the only one who’s shown that to me.
I told everyone already,
I’m tired of throwing 
My pearls before swine
Even though pigs
Seem quite smart. 


If you, MAN, are not aware of how valuable I am,
How much I have to offer,
If you want to follow the other path 
Of all the other
“MEN” who have let me down,
And made me question the value of the whole gender,
Then join the pile.
Say hello to the rest of them.


“Oh hi, how were you not good enough? Oh, I mooched off her. I used her for security when I had no one else. I used her for affirmation when I didn’t believe in myself. I used her as a child-bearer bc I could tell she didn’t think she deserved anyone better than the first (or next) guy who liked her.”


What is the fucking difference here?
What makes me feel like I’ve won the lottery?
Is the difference his devotion?
His abilities and intelligence and strength and caring?
Or is just that I’m all out of options?
Is anything better than I death I was ready to welcome?


No.
Definitely no. 
He is without doubt the “best” guy I’ve ever loved.
He has all the perversity and anti-social nature
With the amiability and desire to not make enemies
To fit in
And have fun,
And the ambition and drive and interest
To finish your terminal degree
(ouch, my boner!)
And get a job
And always have a fucking lady doting after you
And learn how to fuck like a stud
And communicate
And understand women
And cook and love cats and speak german 
And do yoga and not be jealous or mean
And oh my god how did you do it?


I understand how all the women want your sex
And your marriage
But what about your special soul?
And your perversity?
And your fear of having to be what you think you need to be?


They can give you the sex, the love, the marriage, the devotion, even the baby,
But I promise you, John,
They don’t understand and love and support you 
The way i do.


Do you see the difference between a woman
Who is looking for a “perfect” guy, 
And she finds you,
“He cooks, fucks, gets a paycheck, isn’t a tool”
And says, “Bingo!”


Versus me
Who is 100% happy on my own
Because I have a periphery of men
My dad
And michael
And lovers
To meet a modicum
Of the needs
That I know
No man
(one or many)
Can meet.


I learned to rely on myself,
The ghost of michael,
The bolstering of my dad,
The joy of pollys and orange and yellow
The energy and financial boost of my job
The excitement
And randomness
Of my casual dating
And exciting stories
Of disappointing dicks 
And underwhelming men.


We both understand
How difficult we are to please.
We feel so transparent.
I say, 
I give me to you!
Here is the code!
Press it and I’ll be yours!


And you say,
Well,
Maybe I want to…
Are you sure the code will work?

And I say
Well, I thought, but maybe 
Not
And you say the same.


Love me 
Don’t tell me that you love me.
Love me
Treat me like you love me
Love me
Accept my love like treasure
I love you
Accept my love 
However. 


I thought that was a song I knew but now I can’t remember it.


I told him…
I realize now that I was wrong.
I was trying to make you angry
To force you into giving me 
What I wanted.
You did, and it was sooo soo hot,
But you didn’t want to,
And you’ll resent me 
For it 
Eventually.


Now I see that the way
To get what I want
Is to give you what you want. 


But we’re just both so confused!!!


You say that you want to be in control.
That you don’t want me to defy you.
That you want me to submit to you
And your love
Completely.


But we both know you wouldn’t have wanted that
If I hadn’t fought so completely
At the beginning. 


You only want it from me
Because you know
That i didn’t want to give it
And you wrested it from me
With the incredible strength
Of your specialness
And your understanding of me
And the power of your cock
And your spirit. 


And I guess I wrested it from you
In all those same ways.


If you had been desperate for me
If you had clung to me
If you had brought me flowers
A few weeks sooner than you did


I would have had the sinking feeling
Of another guy
Who thinks I’m for him
When he doesn’t know anything at all.
But instead,
You brought them 
At the exact right time
Of the exact right day
To make me say
“WHO is this guy??
Who checks all the boxes
And does all the things
None of the other guys would do
To make me feel special
But also makes me feel hot and wanted
And like his dick is a fucking prize
That I better jump at
And suck suck suck
To show him 
How much i notice his noticing of me
And that I’ve been waiting so long
For a sweet smart special 
“Only for me to understand”
Fucking hot guy
To appreciate me 
And how I appreciate him.


Please John, 
Please don’t let me down.
Don’t let me let you down.
We’re so smart.
We’re so hot
We’re so intentional.


Why do you tell me that you like the variety in me
Like you like variety in women?
I’m not a woman. 
I’m sophy.
I’m yours.
At least,
I could be.


Do you want me
To show
“The other guys”
The new moves 
That you’ve shown me
To make your cock so hard with my mouth???


Are you anxious to pass that on? 


I don’t want to be jealous of you, or possessive.
I don’t want you to be that way with me.


I just need some fucking assurance
That if I continue to give you
EVERYTHING
I have or can think of
That you will continue to 
“Prefer” me 
And most importantly,
Give me your plus one 
To the next big thing.
I want to give you mine.


At some previous point John pointed out
That sometimes in bed
He notices the razor blade,
And would rather not
Sleep with a razor blade,
So could i not?


Um...obviously I’m not 
Leaving 
The razor blade
Loose 
in the bed
On purpose.
I hear you saying that you’re worried about getting a fucking little cut
But i can’t do anything else about it.


I hate these boner stresses.
Fuck the patriarchy!
What if I had to feel bad everytime I needed lube?
I know it’s not related to how turned on you are
I know it’s not related to your masculinity
And i’m sick of it interfering.


I know you’re a fucking man
I know you can fuck me hard
I know your dick gets big enough
To choke my throat.


I don’t need it ALL the time
Remember when i just laid on top of you 
And rubbed on your almost-boner
And came so hard??
Why can’t we do that anymore?


What’s wrong with that?
It’s like if you don’t have a hard-on
None of us gets to get off.
But that’s silly. 
It hurts us both.


I’m telling you that 
Your cock is fucking rad
It’s normally hot and fun and a party time
And sometimes it gets huge and hard
And overwhelms my esophagus and face
And that’s super hot
But i’m glad it’s not all the time.


I just want you to give me a black eye with your love-hardened cock.
Other than that 
I love it when you
Massage me
Spank me
Choke me
Boss me around
Force me to do stuff that I want to do for you anyway
Just grind together and make out
Let me luxuriate in rolling your dick around in my mouth
--anything but making me stress out bc your’re stressed out bc you think i’m stressed out because society and the fucking cock.


You know how I love it so much when you’re sweet and loving and gentle,
But I don’t want it all the time?
Your boner is like that too.
I love it,
But I don’t need it all the time,
So relax.


I’m worried that even bringing it up to ease your mind will make you stress more.
That sucks.
I just don’t like the tension.
And you know I WANT you to be rough on me.
Can you use that as motivation?
Or would you just blame me for it?
It’s not my fault!!!!
I’m hot enough!


Gosh, but really, I feel SO SO SO FUCKING LUCKY, JOHN.
I can’t express it.
Not only are you the most competent and real man I ever dated,
But you made me feel so hot and competent,
And it was just so fun
And hot
And then we accidentally fell in love
And now we’re not alone.


Just because of our dating and attraction 
And willingness to continue to impress the other
We now are not alone
And even more
Have the time
To explore 
This super fucking hot hot hot
Emotional 
Love love love
Time with each other. 


Also...what’s wrong with my pussy??
Have you noticed I haven’t come since a long time?
Why doesn’t that get as much attention as your boner?
Why don’t we worry about that
And make me feel guilty
And prioritize my recovery? 


I know!!!!
BC no one gives a fuck about girl orgasms
Not nearly as much as boy orgasms
Or even boy boners!

The boy would rather have a boner
And me not cum
Than make me cum
Sans his boner.

I should tell john that. 
Worry less about your boner
And more about my cumming. 
Yeah….:)


It’s just that I am going to be SO
So
SO
SOOOO
Fucking pissed
If he’s tricked me into loving him
And being emotional 
And offering my whole self to him,
Only to later back off
And say
Eh….
You’re too easy.


I’ve been trying so hard to play hard to get
Because i was
And i knew he was
And that that’s how it works,
But he’s telling me to forget about that
And i want to believe him
But i’m worried it’s one of those cases
Where even ourselves don’t know what we want. 


Yep, that’s just the way it is.
Neither of us can tell the other exactly what we want
Bc neither of us knows,
Even though we want so badly 
To stay in love.


He asked me for a hint,
But all i ever say,
And i think i’m sincere,
Is that i need to believe he’s perfect
And that i have his love
Because he thinks i’m the best girl
For a perfect guy like him
And he never wants to let me go.


I’m (we’re) so worried about this
Nice-guy persona that isn’t sexy,
But I don’t think it’s the niceness that is the problem.
Those guys are either incompetent,
Insincere,
Or unsexy in a different way.


John’s niceness does not make him less sexy.
His niceness makes him nice
And his SEXINESS makes him sexy. 


He seems to have thought seriously 
About why he was looking at me that way
In the original tie up 
With that big dildo.
I guess his answer
Was that he was 
Relishing the fact that he was so in control.


I was tied up, 
I was blindfolded,
I was in love,
I was turned on.


And it wasn’t even quarantine yet!
But...he knows
he doesn’t need to use those binds
To tie me down.


So if it turns him on to do it,
Don’t i need to make him feel like he has to?


I did decide and learn and agree
That angering him 
By defying him
Isn’t the way to make him 
Satisfy my desire for him
To sexually dominate me


But i’m already worried it’s not working.
But how can I tell him 
Again and again
That i need more stimulation?


I can see how turned on he is
When i’m on all fours
And he’s licking my ass.
He’s thinking about himself
And his relation to my ass,
And i love that.


But my head is way over here
So far from my ass and his head
And i’m lonely and bored
b/c while the ass or pussy licking
Feels real good,
It’s just one tiny tiny part of my body
Not huge like your cock.


I’d rather gain a huge traumatic hot memory
With you
Than try to entertain myself
And wonder what’s wrong with me
That i can’t stay in the moment
From just genital stimulation.
(actually that is obvious
But it’s just again
That my head is in control
Always drawing away my attention
(maybe so she can get my pleasure!?)
And it needs to be overwhelmed
And taught a lesson
That when i’m trying to fuck
It needs to shut the hell up.


Maybe that’s why i like the slapping.
Because it’s a man i admire
Telling my fucking deliquent brain
To shut the fuck up
And pay attention 
To the fact
That he’s about to fuck me
Hard. 


I like it when you make my pussy feel good.
I like it even more when you make my nipples excited.
But most of most of most of all
I love it when you control my whole mind
With your love and power
And the force you exert over my whole body.


Your love is a force! 
I already told you it pained me more
When you kissed my calf so gently
Than when you whipped me.


I don’t think I understand the difference
Between pain and pleasure. 
Sunday day sleep,
I think it was,
You fell asleep before me
Like often,
And i stayed awake in your arms
Thinking again and again
About what you said saturday night
After you first tied me up.


You asked me to listen to you,
Which is rare,
And I did,
And you told me to look at you,
And I always do,
And you told me 
As i remember the sentiment,
“Sophy.
Do not kill yourself.
If you do,
It will BREAK
My
FUCKING 
Heart.
I’ll never get over it;
It will be the tragedy of my life.”


My fucking god, 
How much that is what i wanted to hear.
That is all i wanted.
And his sincerity!
How he said my name,
How he looked in my eyes,
How his voice almost broke
When he said my death
Would 
BREAK 
His 
fucking
heart. 


He said it was the second time he was telling me that.
I guess the first time I was too kurfuffeled to remember
But i’m so so so so glad
He told me again.
It was the highlight of my night
In spite of when he smacked my clamped nipple with the computer case
And made me turn away
And tighten up
And hold my breath
Or breath real fast
Until the pain inevitably started fading
After 3 or 4 seconds
That felt like the way
John counts to ten.
(so slow...not standard or atomic...more punitive)


Or when he smothered me with my favorite towel
After he’d used it to clean up my piss
That i leaked on the ekornes stressless lounger
When i choked on his cock.
Until i thought my eyes went wild
But i guess he couldn’t tell. 


It’s so strange how we do not tend to agree
On which of our sexy moments are the hottest.
In fact we seem to actively disagree.
But he’s a man
And i’m a woman
So i guess that’s no surprise


But we know we’re growing
We’re learning about each other
And sex and love
And communicating. 


But again,
Neither of us can confirm that we really want what we’re asking for.
I try too hard to tell him what i think i want
And i try too hard to think about what he wants
But you still don’t know if that’s enough.


I told him tonight that my favorite part
Of our early sex
Was when he would hold onto my neck with his hands,
And i did love the tightness and the choking
But mostly it was the way he looked at me while he was doing it
The intensity.


I guess now he’s saying he was turned on by how much control he was taking?
But that’s only because he thought it wouldn’t be easy.
If he’s now IN CONTROL,
Where are going to be his opportunities
To TAKE CONTROL?


With the role-playing?
With playful disobedience?
With my natural acquiescence?


I asked if he’d always been seeking a girl
Who would let him take control
And he said no
Because they all did
Right away anyway.
Huh??
And then why did he or they leave?
Will he get tired of me for giving him control?


He says the main complaint of women
Is that he’s not available enough.
Yeah that was mine too.


So he wants to take control of a woman
And then leave her to fend for herself
Which she used to be able to do!
But can’t anymore!
While he’s out doing his own thing
And feeling like hot shit
Because he has control
Of an unsatisfied woman at home?


Has he learned his lesson?
Have I?
I think the lesson I learned is 
Not to pick a shitty guy.


But there must be more to it than that.
I must play a role.
But I’ve often been sweet
I’ve often offered sincerity.


I asked john how i could know
When he wanted easy control.
I said,
If I had offered myself to you that
First night we met at duffy’s 
Would you have wanted me?

He said no, 
That would have been weird.
Lol, that’s not the point.


We all know he wouldn’t have desired to control me
If i hadn’t initially made it so clear
That he could not do that
And i didn’t want him to.
HE was defying me!
And it was only because my defiance
Riled him all up.


So now he tells me he doesn’t’ want that
That he wants me to submit
And comply.
But i don’t trust human nature.
I know he believes that
But i don’t think it will work. 


What can I do???


He says he doesn’t like it when i defy him and make him mad
So he shouldn’t give me what i want when i do.  
I don’t understand why the train tracks was so hot for me
But not for him
And the road was so hot for him
But not for me.


If he wants control,
Pulling up my sleeve
While i’m kneeling on the train tracks
With my head on the rocky ground
Showing my submission
After he slapped me
And kicked me,
And pressing his lit cigarette
Into my arm,


Seems a lot more tough
Than setting me down 
On the deserted road.
But so so so so
Fucking hot to me.
Would he have done that
If he weren’t authentically mad?
Would he have done that
Just for shits and giggles
To wet my pussy?
I just don’t think so.
And even if he did…
Would it feel the same?


I remember i was so submissive
So given up
I forget what you’d just done
Kicked me a lot
And i wanted you to stop
So went in position two
The extreme version
So folded on the ground
On the rocks
Between the rails
And i could hear you
Standing behind me
Breathing heavy
Seething
Considering
Sucking on your cigarette
Exhaling hard
Considering
While i lay so low and folded
Yet peaceful
Awaiting 
Whatever came next
Whatever you decided
I had no fear
Only trust and anticipation
And possibly shame
For having angered you.


And then i heard you walk over
And kneel down behind me
And i waited
The longest moment
And you yanked up my left sleeve
And i didn’t know why
But it surely made sense
And when you pressed your cigarette
Into my arm
It felt so rich
And so right.
It didn’t hurt like the road
It didn’t hurt like when you pushed me away
It felt like…
Honesty
Earnestness
Desperation
Effort
Commitment
Bravery
Faith
Relaxation
Salvation.


I don’t know why.
It really didn’t hurt at all.
I never felt any pain from it.
I just loved the whole thing.
I hate that you didn’t.


Maybe 
part of giving ourselves to each other
Is agreeing to do things
That don’t make us happy
Simultaneously.
(But didn’t Rilke tell us not to give ourselves to each other?
That that results in nothing but a mess?
But why else would I do this?
Who wants to be a part-time sex slave?)
I mean, that’s a lot to ask.
Synchronicity?
In this space-time??




Maybe that’s why everyone 
Is always going on and on
About the simultaneous orgasm.
What’s the big deal?
Just put your memories
Together.
That’s all you’ve got anyway.
Why base so much meaning
Or significance
On something that’s so so fleeting 


And yet, the former,
While sounding more frightening
And leaving significant physical scars,
Made me happy 
And turned me on,
While the latter
Scared the shit out of me.


And vice versa for john.
Is he really going to be motivated 
To burn me with a cigarette
Just to re-express his current control
Without being pressed
To prove it??


I asked if he was also worried
Like me
That there was a chance
We were in a trance
And would wake up soon
Horrified by what we’ve done?


He quickly agreed it was possible,
But seemed less
Worried than me.
He said he wouldn’t be like James Spader in secretary
And say
I’m disgusting I can’t do this anymore
And dump me.


I guess if he decides he can’t do this anymore,
He’ll want to be my boyfriend
Regularwise
Without beating me up.
Obviously that is fine with me!
I like this hot sex,
I like discovering how it can turn me and him on
And how much he can do
And how much i can take,
But honestly….
Really…
We all know that either of us
Would be fucking stoked 
To have the other
As a regular 
Thing


Of course...that would mean something different for me than him.
He’d get to stop thinking up reasons to punish me
But i’m sure i’d still be expected to suck in cock in the same passionate way.
But i need him to turn me on and make me desperate and hungry for it!
Like I am right now.
In an hour there will be the new cuomo update
And i’ll stop this writing
And go back in the bedroom
And prop up the mac
And get somehow under his covers
(he gets so cold at night!)
So that i can hold his dick in my mouth
While I watch cuomo talking
And then i’ll be able to go to sleep.


Today, Tuesday,
I was Dottie (Dorothea)
The small town waitress
Tasked with serving Dr. Lind
And hoping 
That i could entice him
Into taking me on for good
And taking me out of here.


He had been frustrated with me yesterday
Bc i defied him and talked too much
So today i tried to be submissive but sexy
Quiet but useful,
Unseen but noticed.


He complained, 
After he was off the phone with his brother nels
That i didn’t check on him enough.
Didn’t i notice that he’d ended his phone call?
No,
Because I was trying not to eavesdrop
Because i wanted to so bad.
I waited for him to finish and come out
And washed the dishes
After I finished the vacuuming 
And my census.


But then 
I missed him too much,
I couldn’t wait anymore,
So i went into his office
To rest my head in his lap
While he finished his call
But instead he was already done
And disappointed 
That i hadn’t checked 
On his needs.


Doh.
It’s so hard to figure out.
But we’re doing good.
Trying real hard.


I love being his waitress
And secretary
And housecleaner
And sex slave
And favorite thing in the world. 


We talked about ways for me to earn punishments
Without making him mad
Through puzzles
And competitions 
And challenges
And natural corrections
Like when i brewed his tea too long
And he spanked me for it.
I told him it’s the only way.
I’m too sensitive to accept
Criticism 
Outside of 
Primary protocol.


I told him, 
Not only am i known for the 
Tightest pussy
And the 
Deepest asshole
In town,
But i’ve also been known
To solve a wednesday puzzle 
In eighteen minutes or less. 


So we came up with the stakes
And i wrote them on my
Es ist einfach
Waitress notepad that i kept in 
A pocket 
Of my half apron.


I found a stubby little pencil
And clipped it to
A Red Lanyard 
Around my neck.


<18, we watch the first episode of black mirror
18<x<25, he tasks me with sewing more bells on my clothes
>25, he balls up my trashy knee high nylons and shoves then in my mouth.


I did great, almost would have gotten under 18, but for a few clues that were intractable. He helped me a bit, and I finished just over 25.


He said he was impressed, that I’d done very well, and he offered me a deal of the first two instead of the third. I was amazed! “You’re offering me a reward and a medium instead of a punishment? You are too nice!” He said, “Oh, no, you’re still getting the pantyhose in your mouth. But we can watch the show too.” Aha! Still nice. Except he fell asleep and we didn’t. But here I’ve done all this writing and I’m just biding my time before I cuddle him and put his dick in my mouth. 


Have you noticed that I’m cumming a lot less lately? 
Our sex is either you beating me up
Or me sucking your cock
Or you fucking me hard
Or you losing your boner when i’m on top.


And I love then all but the fourth,
And if there’s a good balance of the first three
I probably don’t even care about the fourth
But if there isn’t,
I’ll have to start masturbating.


I asked if he had a nice talk with his brother, 
And if he had been talking about the cuomo updates
When he said they were great
And he’s seen a couple.
He said yes to all,
And then I asked, why did you say a couple, like it’s a casual happenstance, when we (I) have watched it every single day for weeks. He said that to him, a couple means two to six. I said, oh sure, you’re just saying that so that we can be a couple even if you have four other girls. He laughed. 


I just looked at some old thing I’d written when I was frustrated about michael.
I said it’s fine if he wants to give some leftover dick to the other girls,
But NOT while I am left sexually unsatisfied.


If you have enough left over to give to them,
I better be getting all I want. 


We talked about me as Dottie--
If he came back to my restaurant,
And I was there with my ass out whenever he wanted,
And another almost equally hot new girl was there
With her new unseen ass
That he coudln’t touch,
Wouldn’t that seem more enticing?
If she said, “No, my ass is my own secret garden,”
While i was hanging mine out to dry for him,
Wouldn’t his attention be drawn to hers?

He said, not if she teases me about it. 
Then I’ll lose interest
And say, fine, whatever.
So he doesn’t like girls who play hard to get?
I guess he never said he did.
He just said he didn’t want a serious relationship right now.
Those aren’t the same. 


Did I think they were?
I wasn’t playing hard to get either.
I was equally uninterested in a serious relationship
And enjoyed flirting
With him so so so much
Because i could see how it affected him
And made him want me
And i loved it
And wanted to make him want me
More and more.


Remember when I told him 
In an email while he was away
That he’d made me need him
And he’d done it on purpose
So now he owed me
And he said yes,
He’d done it on purpose.


What does that really mean?
He wanted me all along?
He wished I were easier to get?
That it didn’t take the virus
And michael abandoning me
And him giving me the hot hot sex?

We decided our anniversary is
The wednesday (duffy’s dance night)
Of the week around April 24th
(so so few days before summer!
Poor past us)
And i can’t wait to see what he does
That will be so sweet
And me too.


So he told nels that we were
Trying to overcome the traditional
Dysfunction of being with your lover 24/7
And having no other
By exploring bdsm
And codified power dynamics.
John was so brave!
And nels said,
“Oh, that’s nice.”
And changed the subject.


I asked John if he were going to tell rainer
Cause there’s a fellow who wouldn’t flinch
And oh what power that is.
To tell rainer,
I’ve taken charge of sophy.
She’s mine now.
And then fucking back it up.
Amazing. 


Every perverse thing we consider
Turns out to be hotter than we imagined
And a pretty good idea after all.


John said he would have consulted me first,
But yeah, let’s tell him.
How weird
But cool.
It’s quarantine times
And there’s no rules anymore.


I predict Rainer will say,
“Good for you, new John.
I always thought sophy
needed a firm hand.”


And if it starts to get weird
I told him 
Just bring it around 
To Oma and opa.
That I wanted to love someworthy guy
Like she loved him
And take care of him.


But times are so different,
And i’m supposed to be independent
And no man’s gonna pin me down!
And we didn’t have a war
Or religion 
Or a depression 
Or children


So we need another way 
To replicate that dynamic
And inspire me to serve john
And that way is hot sex
And domination.
And devotion.

Wednesday April 8
We came back to our south chico home last night
And he fell asleep
After making delicious
Waffles and eggs
And fucking my face
In my robber mask.


I stayed up all night with the cats
Writing and eating plain waffles
Waiting for cuomo.


John started waking up
He was so happy to see me
I’m making him coffee
Then i’ll suck his cock


And then we’ll make a last trip to costco
To stock up on supplies.
We read each other’s minds.
I want to see if i can do the puzzle
Faster
If he does it first.


And then I sucked his cock
All through cuomo’s update
My jaw was so tired
I couldn’t make it through the questions.


But then he fucked me
And it was sweet.


I told him that i’d been coming less
But have been more turned on
Which is more important
And longer
And hotter
To me.


After he came on my somewhere
We both then had the idea to go to costco
But then fedex told him that his new keyboard
Would be arriving soon
So we were stuck between me napping
And us going
But then when i was by the front door
Cutting myself a little line
(good idea!)
I heard a racket
And opened the door
And there was the delivery guy
And the keyboard
Two feet away from me.


I ran to john and he told me 
To get into the shower immediately
And he was so convincing 
That i didn’t question it.


John thinks i was the drunkest this morning
He’s ever seen me
Since the tequila night
But that doesn’t make sense
Because i was sober later
After having never gone to sleep.


I was a little clumsy
And tired
But that’s all. 


Tonight he made us 
delicious
Italianish pasta
And installed the hooks 
And we played scramble
(he won!)


And i read him a short chapter
From the dead father book.
He loved it
And so did i. 




He asks how i can
Manage to lseep so little 
And still function,
But i’s clear.
It’s mamia
That’s how your brain can owrk
Sometimes
Forsome reasons
But it’s not me beeing cool.
It’s me being sick. 


I man,
I’m still gad
Hou’re impressed. 


Thursday April 9
By Ben Smith
* March 16, 2020
“A crisis shows you a person’s soul,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo mused during a conference call with reporters on Sunday. “It shows you what they’re made of. The weaknesses explode and the strengths are, uh, emboldened.”


He keeps referencing this.
Pretty sure he means me
Not cuomo


But bruce


The River
Bruce Springsteen
I come from down in the valley
Where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride
Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress
That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride, yeah yeah
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well Mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care
But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight, yeah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride, oh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh


I want more room on the page for my words
Like he wants more room for his cock
He wants me to go Ahhhhhhhh
About him
Like i do
About my pain
And how bruce knows it.


It’s the same.
Maybe i’m writhing around
And kicking my feet
And punching my head
And slapping my face
Until i only have 
The rhythm
The melody
The lyrics
And the sadness.


Oh my god I tried to date michael tonight
(Wed April 8)
I thought i could do it
But i couldn’t.

I started crying right away
Faster than i thought
As soon as i saw him
It hurt
It hurt so much
More than burn 
Or because of the scald
Or bc he was still there without me
Or because i wasn’t there with him
And i miss it so much.
I want that blumenbeet to still be mine
I want to be his biggest supporter.






Oh my god.
Michael has killed me.


John pushed me away today
Twice, maybe thrice,
In the last couple of days
Because i annoyed him
Just like i annoyed my mom
And beta
And josey.


Not sean.
Not michael.


But it’s okay.
I know i’m a lot.
I couldn’t handle it myself.


It’s just too soon
And john would probably be really sad without me.
He’d probably wish i was still there annoying him
Than completely gone.


He came into the bedroom
Where i was listening to weird music
And gave me a kiss
And asked me not to be pissy
Because he pushed me away
But i wasn’t
And i told him that.


Usually i would be
Maybe the other girls would be
Maybe he wanted me to be
And normally i would have
Or maybe i was
But it just seemed pretty easy to get over
Comparatively. 


Right when he said that,
*Original Train Story (March 2020) (pg 88)


What can I do???


He says he doesn’t like it when i defy him and make him mad
So he shouldn’t give me what i want when i do.  
I don’t understand why the train tracks was so hot for me
But not for him
And the road was so hot for him
But not for me.


If he wants control,
Pulling up my sleeve
While i’m kneeling on the train tracks
With my head on the rocky ground
Showing my submission
After he slapped me
And kicked me,
And pressing his lit cigarette
Into my arm,


Seems a lot more tough
Than setting me down 
On the deserted road.
But so so so so
Fucking hot to me.
Would he have done that
If he weren’t authentically mad?
Would he have done that
Just for shits and giggles
To wet my pussy?
I just don’t think so.
And even if he did…
Would it feel the same?


I remember i was so submissive
So given up
I forget what you’d just done
Kicked me a lot
And i wanted you to stop
So went in position two
The extreme version
So folded on the ground
On the rocks
Between the rails
And i could hear you
Standing behind me
Breathing heavy
Seething
Considering
Sucking on your cigarette
Exhaling hard
Considering
While i lay so low and folded
Yet peaceful
Awaiting 
Whatever came next
Whatever you decided
I had no fear
Only trust and anticipation
And possibly shame
For having angered you.


And then i heard you walk over
And kneel down behind me
And i waited
The longest moment
And you yanked up my left sleeve
And i didn’t know why
But it surely made sense
And when you pressed your cigarette
Into my arm
It felt so rich
And so right.
It didn’t hurt like the road
It didn’t hurt like when you pushed me away
It felt like…
Honesty
Earnestness
Desperation
Effort
Commitment
Bravery
Faith
Relaxation
Salvation.


I don’t know why.
It really didn’t hurt at all.
I never felt any pain from it.
I just loved the whole thing.
I hate that you didn’t.


Maybe 
part of giving ourselves to each other
Is agreeing to do things
That don’t make us happy
Simultaneously.
(But didn’t Rilke tell us not to give ourselves to each other?
That that results in nothing but a mess?
But why else would I do this?
Who wants to be a part-time sex slave?)
I mean, that’s a lot to ask.
Synchronicity?
In this space-time??


Maybe that’s why everyone 
Is always going on and on
About the simultaneous orgasm.
What’s the big deal?
Just put your memories
Together.
That’s all you’ve got anyway.
Why base so much meaning
Or significance
On something that’s so so fleeting 


And yet, the former,
While sounding more frightening
And leaving significant physical scars,
Made me happy 
And turned me on,
While the latter
Scared the shit out of me.


And vice versa for john.
Is he really going to be motivated 
To burn me with a cigarette
Just to re-express his current control
Without being pressed
To prove it??


I asked if he was also worried
Like me
That there was a chance
We were in a trance
And would wake up soon
Horrified by what we’ve done?


Second Train Story-Poem
Oh my god. I was right. I just didn’t think i’d get the evidence so fast. 


“Sophy. You don’t know what kind of trauma i have in me. I think i could really hurt you.”


Sometimes when you’re defying me and refusing me to do what I want I just get so angry. I guess you can use your safe word and see if I listen to it.


He seems really unsure of whether this is what he wants.
He seems to be telling me that he doesn’t think this is sexy.
I’m honestly surprised that I do.


We really leveled up tonight.
You can’t go back.
You get desensitized
Like a frog in boiling water.
Ha. i bet he’s worried that he’s the frog.
I’m not the frog.
I’m the flame.


I wonder what he’s doing out there.
He wanted his massage but i scoffed and said give me half an hour. 


He didn’t argue


If he wants me to be meek why doesn’t he teach me to be meek?


Out on the train tracks 
he tried to put his cock 
in my mouth 
but i held my teeth shut tight. 
He said “open your mouth.” 
I clenched my mouth tight 
Except for just a millisecond and a millimeter to flirtily say,
“Make me.”


He slapped me hard on both sides and i saw not just stars but flashes of light.


Everytime he pushed me down i sat back up and i stared at him.


I knew that he didn’t feel free to give me what we both wanted.
I had to force him into it.
He had no choice.


He knows that if he really wanted to be cruel to me, he would pick me up and drop me back at my house and not call me. 


He knows all I want is his attention.


He doesn’t want to be cruel to me. 
Does he? 
He’s not sure.
Cruelty isn’t sexy to him.


Which part of this IS sexy to him?


I didn’t expect him to kick me in the face. 
I didn’t expect him to kick me so hard on my body and my head.
I didn’t expect him to push me down so hard on the rocks.
He pushed me down so my back was on the track
And i forget what else


When I fought him for his belt, it wasn’t just to be contrary.
I didn’t want him to get it because I didn’t want him to use it on me.
But when he won it from me I looked at him
And he slapped my face with it
And then i looked down


He whipped my ass, which was now showing bc he ripped my pants,
Three times and it hurt very much
And i wanted to wiggle away
And i was very relieved that he didn’t do it a fourth time


And then i was satisfied,
And i got into position two
And i tried to bury my ass into my knees
So he couldn’t get at it


And i put my head down in the rocks
And i put my arms out in front of me
And i put my hands together like
I was praying to him to stop


And i waited like that for 
What seemed like a very long time.
I was breathing hard
And i hoped he could hear the relief in my breaths


I could hear him breathing hard
And thinking hard.
I’m surprised this is so hard for him.
I thought it would be easy.


Maybe that’s the problem
It’s too easy for him
And things that are easy aren’t satisfying
I know that.


He kicked me in the head,
So close to my eye
I feel it throbbing now.


I’ve never had a black eye
Will i now?
We’re in quarantine so no one will see.
No one needs to know.


It’s so private.
I asked him to pay the transient
9 dollars to watch him rape me
But he didn’t think it was worth it.


Now he has 9 dollars 
And apparently a lot of thinking to do


He did tell me i was helping to heal his soul
At the time i thought
But this is so easy.
It ought to be harder 
Or why didn’t anyone do it?
Couldn’t anyone do it?


I DON’T WANT TO DO SOMETHING ANYONE COULD DO
But i would be so sad if he decided i was right
And that he ought to pick just anyone after all


What is the point to him 
of me 
if he is satisfied with so little?
He wants a sex doll?
A girlfriend?
A wife?


I can’t be any of those things.
It’s funny that he made me think i could,
And has now proven to me that i can’t.


I’m so afraid that’s what he wants. 
He loves me 
I should be meek for him.


I’m trying to show him how much i want to give him
By showing how hard he has to fight
And how hard i am to earn
But maybe he just wants someone to kiss his feet
Just because
And not because it feels so so nice
Compared to being kicked by them


What is the value of kindness 
if that’s all you have 
to offer?
If he is nice to everyone,
Why do I want him to be nice to me? 


[Maybe what’s special
Is removing his face.
He’s not really nice
And he shows that to me.
How lucky I am.
I’m the one that he trusts.
He can reveal his true self
And know I won’t go
Is all love pathetic?
Is it only a game? 


I hate all the men
Who’ve inspired the pain
For women to write (die)
About issues of life
That shouldn’t have anything
To do with these men]


Am I making him face parts of himself that will
Make him sad 
instead of happy?
Bring him pain 
instead of joy?


I thought offering my pain,
My very, very, very fucking valuable special suffering,
Would show him how much
I think his happiness is worth.


But maybe he just wants it easy
Summertime
Etc.


I like the summertime too
I want it to be summer all year long
But i’m not trying to languish.


I’m just so fucking bored of life. 
I had it too easy
It doesn’t seem worthwhile


I can’t find something real to fight for
So i’d like to fight john 
Until he fights me back enough
That surrendering to him
Is enough of a win.


You saw the look on his face!!!
You saw how he looked at me when he 
Waved that heavy giant dildo at me
Before he hit me in the face with it.


I didn’t expect that.
I didn’t ask for that.
It was his idea.
He enjoyed it.
It was plain on his face.


  
   


And now look what he’s doing!!!!
He’s gaslighting me into thinking that I 
am forcing him into something 
He doesn’t want
That he knows is bad
That he is warning me is bad


When all along 
he surely wants it as much 
as i do
And feels guilty about it
So is forcing me into the position of 
begging for it
And being the instigator
So he doesn’t need to answer 
to his apparent moral qualms
About wanting to kick me in the head
And burn me with his cigarette.


So fucking classic.
I loved it, too.
I really did. 


It didn’t hurt as much as I expected.
I wasn’t sure what was happening when he pulled up my sleeve
I was already in my most submissive position
When he kicked me over


Then i returned to my most submissive position again
And he kicked me over again
 
And i returned to my most submissive position…
...maybe he didn’t see it as such
...maybe he wanted me 
to stay on my side
(how should I know?)


But he just really deserves more than that!!!
Why doesn’t he see it? 
He could find so many women to abuse
Who wouldn’t appreciate the meta-abuse of it all
And that would be real abuse.


I think I’m smart enough to know what I’m asking for.
I hear him telling me,
“I’m afraid if we keep doing this
I might really injure you.”
So if I keep going,
I’m giving him permission to 
“Really injure” me.


Whatever that means.
A scar on my previously perfect fucking face?
That no one got off on?
A broken heart?
A bunch of hidden scars that no one ever sees
And we both got off on? 


Or is that just my fantasy and not his? 
Is that my fantasy?
Why?


Is his hidden trauma more than mine? 
I told him I would heal his soul 
And no one ever said it would be easy.


If it’s easy,
SOMEONE FUCKING ELSE SHOULD DO IT.


I’d rather he dump me now
And find his chinese hausfrau
And leave me to my own
Deeper pain
That requires a more serious and particular and rarer fucking cure.


It’s funny that we were on this path even before the virus hit.
But it’s such a fucking perfect millieu for this.
For MY fantasy?
What is HIS fantasy?
I thought they were the same.


Maybe I’d rather NOT talk about for once
If the outcome is 
he won’t give me what I want.
This is clearly what I want.


That time out on the railroad tracks…
My god, so intense.
It was so real and outdoors and visceral 
and emotional and physical 
and scary and unknown 
and new and unexpected and brave 
How did he not love it??
He did exactly what I wanted and more.


My god the fucking cigarette.
What a good idea.
So many people have lived through that pain
And it wasn’t sexy to either party.
Why why why?
And if it’s sexy to me 
But not him 
Then I AM the abuser??
“She made me do it!”


No, no, no.
He wants this as much as i do
He feels guilty because he’s a nice guy
And he’s progressive
And he doesn’t want to be a misogynist
And he doesn’t want to have a bad soul
And he doesn’t want to have a secret desire to cause harm
And he doesn’t want to lose control
And he doesn’t want to hurt me.


So he’s trying to give me a chance out,
And if i don’t take it, 
Then whatever happens next is all my fault
And out of his hands.


Fine.
I’ll take the blame.
I think it’s a bit cowardly,
But he’s the least cowardly
Of all the men I’ve loved
So i’ll take what i can get. 


I wish he would own it.
I wish he would admit 
He would get as much pleasure 
out of Whatever
As I would.

But if I’m wrong,
If he really doesn’t like it,
Then I guess I’d rather 
He keep up his nice guy act
And suck it fucking up
And kick me in the head
Against his own better judgment
Because he knows
That’s what i want.


And i guess it is.
I don’t know why.
But I’ve sensed it for a while,
And now I can’t deny it.


I loved it.
I fucking loved it. 


I loved staring him down,
I loved asking him to smack me down,
I loved it when he did it,
I loved it when I kept asking for more,
And he gave it,
And I loved it 
When I’d had enough,


And i could just hide my head
And breathe my breaths
And appreciate where i was
And how i felt
And that i wasn’t in active pain
But could be at any moment
And it wasn’t because of his grace
Possibly because of my
HARD WON submission


And I didn’t have any fucking brain space
To worry about this and that and the fucking other
That i’m usually worried about. 


That was a new new new experience for me.
Physically and emotionally and sexually and life-like.
It was so intense.
It was such a surprise.


He pleased me so much.
I hope he appreciates that.
He took me exactly to the edge.
He showed me exactly the attention I wanted.


Maybe I just want someone to fucking notice me.
Whether I’m impressing them
Or pissing them off.
I just want attention,
And I want a lot of it, 
And I want it to be rapt.
I want his rapt fucking attention


And i want it to be because i’m causing him a bigger fucking problem 
Than whatever math he’s doing
And I want him to figure out a fucking elegant way
To solve the problem that
I am creating for him right now.


That’s what I’m doing. 
I’m making a big fucking mess for him
And I’m dragging him deeper and deeper into it
And he knows it.


The reason that night he tied me up at my house 
And we made the hottest porn ever
Isn’t my sexiest wildest moment
Is bc that was B.V.


How could anything that happened before this
Carry anything near the weight of 
What’s happened after?
The baseline has shifted.


Things that meant something before
Don’t mean anything anymore.
I need to find more
And he wants to help me.


What do I do to keep this?
Do I pretend to back down?
Will I lose him if I push too far?
I’d rather die of the truths
Than live with the lies.


I’ve given up enough already.
Maybe he’s sad that he 
Is now tasked 
With curing my pain
That men other than him have caused
Even though it will cause him pain


That’s the sweetest fucking love.
Maybe that’s what he’s thinking about out there.
Is he willing to live with the responsibility of 
Milliondollarbabying me
To make me happy?


That would be the ultimate fucking love.
For him to wonder forever 
If he did the right thing
By saving me
In the only way possible.


By relieving me of the responsibility.


What can I give him in exchange???
I thought I could offer my pain
I thought I could offer my will
I told him
“You can break me”
I told him
 “I want you to break me”
“I want it to mean something”
“I’m not giving it for free”
I know that men need to earn something
I know you need to prove something to the world.


I’m a thing.
I’M A VALUABLE FUCKING THING


And i’m not easy to get
And a lot of people want me
A lot of men want me
Even my dad wants me 
Beta wants me


A million guys would take care of me right now
For FREEEEE
For fucking no fucking effort on my behalf at all
And here I am 
TELLING YOU 
THAT YOU
ARE THE ONLY MAN
I HAVE EVER
FOUND WORTHY
OF MY FUCKING PRECIOUS SELF


And I know that I can just SAY that,
And so I’m trying to 
PROVE
To you that I am WORTH
Your time and effort
And introspection
And saving


He’s probably scared 
Because he can tell
I don’t care.


Maybe I’ll trick him 
Into going to far
And then he’ll be left
To deal with the consequences
Bc he still cares
And i don’t.


What’s that sound?
What’s he doing out there?


I suppose it’s possible,
Highly possible,
That he knows more than i do
And i should be heeding his warning
And I’ll realize my mistake too late
And i am just a stupid girl.


But if that’s true, 
Then i deserve what i get.


Doesn’t he want to indulge his Pirate-tendencies?
He has a chance to tie me up for five weeks
And kick me and rape me
And threaten to cut off my face
And cut off my face
And get away with it.
Just like pirate did.


No one will notice.
They’ll think I died of the virus.


I’d just hate to think he’s doing it for me.
I want to do it for him.
I’ve always been so selfish.
I’d like not to continue to ruin lives.


But then, if he’s willing to live
With the infinite guilt
Of killing me
Without desire
For my own behalf,
I guess that’s as much of a win
As giving some asshole
His biggest jizz.


And you know what?


I DON’T CARE.


I’m sure that your life on its own 
Is worth more than
Your life plus me as your sex slave


So if you don’t want me either
I’ll give up.


And you can split 
The blame with beta 
And sean
And michael
And my mom and dad


But you’ll never get to know my secret!
Ha. 
Even if you don’t care that much
You’ll be annoyed by not knowing.


Are you annoyed that i figured out 
That 
I have to MAKE you???


I’m so fucking sick of having to make my own reality.
You’ve done better than anyone else at helping me do that. 


So thank you a fucking lot, and I mean it when you sneeze and I say “Bless your heart” because I’m that fucking sweet and I do love you that fucking much.


I already told you this, but maybe it means more after you kicked me on the train tracks, but when you fell asleep before me last night I kissed you so softly again and again all over your face, and I whispered to you that I love you, and I looked at you wish such sweetness and sincerity and had never felt so grateful to be in the intimate presence of another person before. And that was even before tonight. 


I don’t know if you’re here to hurt me or love me but either way i am eternally grateful. 






Okay fuck you too. Technology and cats
It’s just that i’m asking him for his love
And then during the tenderest part of the sex
When he was kissing me so gently on my legs
And it was the most painful part of the sex
And i wonder why






Train Poem (fucked with; not original; trying to be but not a poem) 
And you really did it
I was right about you
You exceeded my expectations
You won my love again


My high expectations
Aggravated you
Fed your reluctance
My insistence on experience
Infuriated you 
And reduced your indulgence


You didn’t want to do it
I didn’t make it easy
I pushed you to anger
What else did I expect?


You can’t boss the little prince
You can’t force his will
You can try…
And see how you end up


Will you end up like me?
Curled up on the ground?
Your face in the gravel
Keeping it safe


Your limbs pulled in close
Tucked underneath
A turtle in fear
Hiding deep in the gravel


I’d never been beat up like that
Never been knocked around
To the point I don’t like it
And frantically try to escape




My face in the ground
My knees pulled up tight
You kneeled down beside me
It would all be all right


You squatted down 
My arms by my head
You waited a second
To fill me with dread?
Or love?
Or desperation?
Or fear? 
Fear of what?


I still heard you breathing
I will 
NEVER FORGET
The sound of you seething
It was nothing like love.
Did I think it was lust? 
Or proof of our dedication??


I’m sure you were only hateful
nothing but hateful
Only you were oppressed
Forced to do things
You would never have guessed
(well..maybe?)
You thought I was the master
Forcing your hand
You never wanted to do this
But you’d do anything to make me happy
Right? 


You squatted beside me
You seethed in my ear
You pulled my sleeve down
Well, yanked my sleeve up
I wasn’t clear about directions
But I was cleared out inside


You yanked it
Up to my elbow
I thought
This is new!
What will he do?
What’s about to happen?


My trust was so strong
I waited 
I waited
I waited for you
Like I was going to say “I do”


I had NOTHING but faith
In what you had planned
Excitement
Anticipation
Love?
Trust?
Faith?
What?


The yank was so sure
So strong and convinced
I really didn’t know 
what you were going to do
I don’t know when I even knew.
You must have made a movement
Reached out your hand
I must have felt something
Something?
A sting or a pinch?
A smell or a sound?


I didn’t feel it
But I sensed it 
But when did I know?
Did I lift up my arm 
And see what you’d done?
Or did I just pull my sleeve down
And flatten my dress
And say “good job baby”
And praise our success (admire)


I don’t remember 
Any reaction
The moment’s disappeared.
I just remember the aftermath
When it was done 
And I knew


That you were just the coolest guy
You always knew what to do
To reclaim your power
And show me your worth


What a brilliant idea!?
Who would have thought?
No one normal would do this!
He must be so special!


I don’t know what happened next
I think we were filled with relief
You’d diffused the tension
With tenderness and ease


What else could you have done?
To show me your strength?
It reminds me of the time
You spit in my face


I don’t know what happened
How i got up from the tracks
Did you hold out your hand?
Did you help me up?
(oh I’m sure you did!) 
You’re the first real man I’ve loved




Or did I pick myself up? Or if I lifted myself up,
Did I clean up our mess
By straightening my knees
And flattening my dress


Did I pull up/down my sleeve?
Did I see what you’d done?
Did I admire your work?
But I knew that you’d done it
And that was enough


No future
No consequence
No trauma
No doubt


You’d done the right thing
I couldn't think anything else
Maybe we had sex
My hands avoiding broken glass
I don’t remember


We made it back to your car
Chatting away
And as we drove from the tracks
We fucking heard the train.


How long had we been there?
Screwing around?
All the danger inside us
No need for more


But it seems like just a second
After we drove away
The train honked its horn
(my favorite sound)
And we both broke out laughing
And maybe held hands


What a Perfect ending!
To such a beautiful night!
Our love so secured
I’m finally safe.
The only threat’s from outside
Getting crushed by the train
But we avoided it!
Together!
He’ll save me to the end


The closer we came
To getting crushed by the train
While we fucked so in love,
The more I was okay


We missed that big payoff,
But we both got the joke
So close to destruction
But we were already there


We rode off towards home
Feeling like all was okay
I knew now I could trust you
And would do anything for you
